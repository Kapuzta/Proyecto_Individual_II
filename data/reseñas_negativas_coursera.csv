I did not find this course helpful. The assignments seem to ask for more info that you've been taught in any of the videos. My analogy for the course is this: It's like making a newborn baby watch a video on swimming and then throwing it into the ocean and acting shocked when it doesn't know how to swim. The mentors in the discussion forum are condescending and do not help when you don't understand the terms they are using. I would not recommend this course for beginners.,8
"I got a 95% and maybe I learned something but I can honestly say it wasn't because I watched the videos - the professor is seriously disconnected. Programming for ""Everybody""? I know what I want to do with programming, but all the examples and small programs you write in this course give you no idea of what of someone outside science and math will ever use programming for. ",8
"Two weeks of all sort of nonsense, including macarena, Harry Potter, sorting hat, videos of meaningless travels and lots of self-promotion. Pure crap that doesn´t worth anybody´s time. When theory started on week 3 it was confusing, boring and as time is life I decided to quit.  It shocked me that a serious university like University of Michigan has a clown on its payroll.",8
We tried to use this class to teach a brown bag lunch for our employees interested in programming.  Python is a great language but this class has a very low content to volume ratio (nobody wants to watch the instructor meet his life-time idol at a trade-show or watch the Intel versus AMD melt-down commercials over their lunch break).,8
"To be honest, I thought the course stumbled and fell short.  It was too basic and slow paced.  The tone was a bit immature at times, and perhaps appropriate only for a grade school level classroom--not something for working professionals.  And it's certainly not mature enough or challenging enough for a university class.  Even if the goal were to teach those with no programming experience, it could accomplish that  while providing more content, and making the content relevant. Is the course worth the price?  Hell no.  If you do pay, you may feel very cheated at the end.  The entire course can be reduced to 3 pages of notes.  One would be better off checking into other free, online tutorials.    I'm not sure about the value of the videos titled ""Office Hours.""  They all appeared as self-promotional behavior from the professor, as if to say, ""hey look how great I am making this video in Paris.""  They're really nothing more than that.  In one video, he corners a guest speaker at a conference, who appears annoyed after a few minutes and gives the professor a polite brush-off:  ""other people here would like to talk with me too.""  After all of these videos, you will ask yourself, ""okay, why did Severance make me watch that?""  ""What was the point?""  And you'll shrug your shoulders and say, ""another waste of time.""",8
"Most vague info, assignments don't even have  anything to do  with the videos, and the videos are not helpful because they don't give any examples. Terrible, and extremely hard. I do not recommend this course to beginners, or to anyone for that fact. ",8
"I am very disappointed with this programming course. The course lacks detail and deepth and could be taught in 45 to 60 minutes instead of 7 weeks. The quizzes and assignments were to easy and basic (solved in less than 5 minutes) and definitely not enough. Annoying was the overuse of colours in almost every video (almost everything was coloured - highlighting everything is just as usefull as highlighting nothing, green box with white text inside - did you try to read that on a different monitor than yours?), the pointless and useless doodles, smilies and whatsoever, wasting my time by watching you dispose your teabag/drinking tea or coffee/talking about your mug/etc., why do you even need to drink in a 20 minute-or-less video. The Tutor tried to loosen a dry topic. Mostly it wasn't my humor but I can live with that. I had hoped for more :(",8
This course has been dumbed down so much that no moderately intelligent person should be subjected to it.  Coursera really needs to rethink its approach to teaching.  I can only express my sympathy for those were seduced into actually paying for this course.,8
This Course is bad! I try to ask for help and then mentors only reply with I cant help you because of the Honor code. Well tat doesn't sound like much of an honor code to me. Of course I am doing my own work duh! I just need help. Dont we all need help from time to time. I think Coursera needs a lot of improvement. I am extremely dissatisfied with Coursera and this course but especially the mentors and their lack of mentoring. Education should be uplifting and positive and an area where individuals can ask question and receive help and not be scolded for asking help or asking questions like a beat down dog. I mean really I think Coursera needs to go take some hints from a real school or university and seek information on education and how it is best when students teach each other and If I can ask for help and learn from others and give then the opportunity to help me that whats the point of a discussion board. Do away with the discussion board or change the way the honor code is written. Yes I agree with Honor and doing your own work but come on. Help and tutoring is a valuable part of education and necessary to learning! Please make the necessary changes to better Coursera and make it a more positive educational experience. I mean please I am trying the best I can with what I have got and no one seems to want to help me learn and improve on my skills and my understanding. Make changes and make them now.Another reason I hate this course Is that Coursera does not believe in people helping one another. Then the mentors cant even explain how to work through the problem. The menotrs make things more stressful than they need to be because the dont give help or hints or clues. People need to talk to people on the phone or in person or the instructor needs to give better examples so people can better figure things out on their own. I just think Coursera is crap and this has been a very unpleaseant experience for me. Then on the discussing board i see others struggling with the same things and the mentos dont help them. People are pleading for help and not receiving any guidance or direction to help them figure things out. Things need to change with this program. They need to change soon!,8
" If I were to compare the quality of this class to something I would say that this class is like a Chess class that spends 30 minutes explaining how pawns work and then asks you to move Knight to C3. ""Wait, what piece is the Knight? How does the Knight move again? What's C3? Help!""  That's basically what you will get out of this course.This class is not a good choice for someone starting from the ground up. It's no so much that it doesn't cover entry-level concepts, rather it fails to elaborate on these concepts. The feedback from the quizzes doesn't point you in the direction where you can learn from your mistakes.Likewise the assignments are often two steps ahead of the video, meaning that when error messages pop up in the auto-grader there is no way to figure out where you can learn what you did wrong. the videos will cover steps a, b, and c but the assignments expect you to know steps d, e, and f. This leaves students to discuss the answers in the forums or on other sites which I understand is frowned upon. However for ""green as grass"" students this is the only way to get anything done. And when students try to explain how the code actually works to each other their threads get locked down, only cryptic and vague responses to issues will remain.  That is abysmal.When I seem to get more help from other students in the comments than from the moderators in the forum, that is an issue. And lets talk about the moderator, there is only one. One for how many students? One for how many questions? Even if there was just 5 more people answering in the forums it would greatly improve the quality of this class. And those moderators should do more than just refer students back to the book which often provides insufficient information to tackle a problem. This class needs to be reviewed extensively.  I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone fresh that wants to try to learn code. ",8
"i feel this isn't a course for beginners it should be for intermediates as i found the exercises very hard and moreover the instructor teaches basic stuff and the graded assignments are tough before some assignments he doesn't even discusses those type of problems. All i'm saying is anybody taking this course as a beginner without any prior knowledge in programming ,he/she would be discouraged.",8
"Very simple, very slow. For someone with programming experience it is a drug, for someone new to programing (I am thinking my son) not very captivating. ",8
"Too easy of a course, completed in a day without much effort... And didn't really get as much out of it as I thought I would.",8
It does not worth a penny to spend time in this course. ,8
Time wasting & rubish,8
"This is most definitely NOT for ""Everybody.""  The lectures by Severance are great; but, if you get stuck on an assignment, don't expect straightforward, polite direction from the forum and it's TAs.  I was shocked by how negative some of the responses were that I received from the TA.  I got stuck on a problem.  When I ran the program on my Mac, I got the desired result.  When I ran the same program on the automatic grader, the program failed.  The TA said that I must have run the wrong program on my Mac.  No, I did not.  I ran the program so many times, I know that I wasn't running the wrong program.  I needed help ""getting over a hump"" and there was no help.  As a busy professional, I don't have the life of a full-time student filled with numerous hours to try to figure out where I'm making a mistake.  I need direct communication telling me where why my program is failing and why, so I can learn and move on.  That was NOT provided in this class.  ""Clues"" were given in the forum, but I don't have time to play games with snarky TAs.  I'll find a course that IS for everyone, but this one is NOT it.",8
This coursera team has given me a night mare today. The course is superb and the tutor is also very good. But the thing is regarding their prices. I purchased this entire course(5 courses) for 49$ initially. But later I thought of applying for the financial aid for the entire course. I applied and waited for 15 days to receive the status. After 15 days the financial aid is approved. After completing the first course in this 5 course part it is asking me to purchase another course for 79$. Team please remember one thing any one would apply for financial aid to seek help from you.  Not to keep burden. I cannot apply for the financial aid again as I was in my last semester and I want to complete the course asap. Now I was in total confusion and they totally betrayed me. So the next four courses would cost me 79*4=316$ and my first price for all the 5 subcourses is 49$. Just compare yourself. This is totally unacceptable.,8
This course is absolutely pathetic. The instructor is condescending and there is very little that you can learn from this course. The course is structured poorly. Short videos that have very little connection with the actual course material are thrown around the course structure. There is no continuity because of these videos. This is definitely not good quality material on python for beginners. Do not be deceived by the high rating of the course. You will be disappointed.,8
"Very brief and inadequate for a $50 investment.I am very disappointed that the course was, surprisingly and unexpectedly cut off in the middle of the already too short beginning course. Even more cash required to continue. Compared to online free resources available, definitely not worth the investment.  I wish I had my money back to put to better use.I am surprised even further by all the online positive reviews that encouraged me to start with Coursera.Mark London",8
"Chapter One,  is absoluty time loss,  is ego storm, not need lisenone chapter,  no have teory for read,  exercises. only   bla bla bla.and bad speakersNo tiene español...  pero lo que escrbi fue..El capitulo Uno,  ¡un capitulo completo¡  no enseña nadaes absolutamente tiempo perdido, es una tormenta de egos, no necesito escuchar eso.no tiene lecturas, no ejercicios,  solo  bla bla blay los relatores son pesimos,  pueden ser inteligentes,  pero no son instructores.",8
"While the lectures were a little slow about providing information, they were entertaining.But I feel very mislead about the costs. The lecturer repeated over and over how everything is free but, in the end, only the first course in the series is free. Then you must pay a monthly fee in order to go on. I would not have continued with the first course if I'd known that was all there was going to be. ",8
"I decided not to pay for this course.  They make it almost impossible to cancel.  After thoroughly searching and searching on how to cancel I finally was able to.  A few days later they charged my card anyway.  Of course they say no refunds, but I tried to call and complain anyhow.  Well, I couldn't find anyone to call or even email.  I feel like this is all a scam.  Not cool.",8
"Pacing is terrible, too much bloat content, and concepts are not explained in an accurate or useful way. For example, the professor talks about ""talking to Python."" This metaphor doesn't make sense and doesn't convey how programming actually works. It is frustrating that something as elegant as programming is taught in such a sloppy and condescending way.",8
I must not learn well by video or align with the teaching methods. I really had to work through my own understanding and application of Python that I think we kept at a very general brush. I wanted to learn to learn Python for my work in baseball and statistics but it didn't meet the standard. ,8
"Too much 'noise' in the teaching videos. Number of words could be at least 5 times less with the same learning content.This type of videos makes it really hard to follow a course since it teaches you not to give attention, since 80% of the videos is noise.Needs a lot of cleanup.",8
"This course is way too slow  and boring. I am disappointed I have paid so much for so few content here. Why a full specialisation cycle when one or two courses would probably have been more than enough ? Too much distraction as well, with ""funny"" videos that I had to pay for...",8
The class is very very basic for the offered price. Not suitable for someone from Computer science background looking to learn Python as this can be done with couple of hours of self study. Not sure why Coursera would make such begginers class mandatory for the specialization. ,8
"Videos. Lots of videos. It's essentially like watching a YouTube montage, but far less entertaining or informative. No hands-on exercises, with very simple assignments and tests. (Although tests and assignments shouldn't be difficult at this level). ",8
"If you plan to purchase this course, enjoy, but the course isn't really free.You can watch the lectures, but you must pay to unlock the python playground. There's no real point to the course if you can't test your knowledge. ",8
The teaching is very bad. It is a basic manners not drink coffee/tea while teaching on the video. Also the explanations are very general and doesn't feel like programming class but feels like some fish market. ,8
"
Pretty bad as far as I am conerned. I spent two days clicking back and forth and listening to a lot of talk that taught me nothing. Sorry about that, but there are better courses on the Internet than this one.
",8
Trivial course.  This 7-week course can be easily completed in an hour.  I learned nothing from this course that I did not already know about python.  This course is strictly for beginners.,8
"Here in the certificate  written ""an online non-credit course authorized by University of Michigan and offered through
Coursera""so there is no credit  then ,it is not benefit to me",8
"I got really bored with the class. In the beginning, my goal was to write a computer code but the first week was only about the business side. Maybe I'm more hands on.",8
Suddenly thrust into Windows command lines. Incomprehensible. The course advertisement stated that no prior experience is necessary -- not so! Enormous waste of time.,8
"



I singed up for this suppossed free course and now I got charged 44 euros. I do not want this and I deamand a refund. I'had already cancell all my subscriptions.",8
"Only for those who are new to everything involving computers. If you know how to turn your own computer off and on, look for a more advanced course than this.",8
I did like this course however it is very very basic. I think it should have been merged with course 2 as the course contents are as good as one week work.,8
"It is not that much useful, because there is no that much content to implement new things.So change that immediately otherwise it is waste of money.",8
"The title of this class should have read ""Programming for Anybody that already knew a decent amount about basic Programming(Continuing with Python)""",8
Course did not meet my expectations. I would not have paid the $80 for it knowing what I know now. I also found the lectures to be not very helpful. ,8
"After week 4, it says upgrade to submit but I have financial aid for this course and it still says upgrade to submit for the assignment.",8
"Great introduction and the instructor is very charismatic, but the material wasn't sufficiently taught for completing exercises.",8
"Not clear enough to be introductory. There are better and free videos on YouTube. Not at the level I was expecting for the ""M"".",8
Its very bad for me that it is a non credit course shown after i have completed this and i have got certifiate of nkn credit,8
"Escuse me , I  done a mistake,I kindly request you to unenroll me from this course.                   Thanking you",8
"This is not a start, at the end of the course, you still can't use python. And even the tools don't work properly. ",8
"Bad, no interaction. I'm billed without ordering. No way to contact CourserA !Bad, bad bad ... this never again.",8
the course covered very little topics of python (20%). Giving 7 weeks is a waste of time to learn basic things. ,8
i had technical problems with both coursers's online system and also with the 3rd party online coding tool,8
The teacher approaches the students like a naive pal. Completely unprofessional and noneducational .,8
I don't get my certificate till now this is very disappointing please provide me my certificate,8

the name on my certificate is not correct then what is use of learning this entire shit!,8
"Por favor pueden ayudarme para cancelar este curso, no lo voy a tomar por el idioma.",8
  Poor feedback and advice with those who really do not know of programming. To shame!  ,8
Not user friendly and the presentatation is very difficult including the navigation,8
Course is not good and interactive course instructor will not respond any queries ,8
"Better off using Udemy, more organized, cheaper and better instructors that way.",8
"Hate this class, I wasted 200 bucks on this crap and now I am stuck taking it...",8
  Horrible TAs. They should all be changed. They are extremely rude and annoying.  ,8
There is too much time spent on stuff that isn't programming.  It's maddening.,8

"Too much introduction. There is no need to spend so much time on it. People that take this course usually understand what is data science. they need to learn real knowledge, not spend the whole week on introduction. ",14
"Too basic. If you live under a rock and have never heard of Data Science, a Data Scientist or any terms related to this industry then this is a wonderful course for you. For everyone else, it is a total waste of time. ",14
"Very, very basic... completely useless and a waste of time. I feel like the only purpose of this course is to drag out the certification process so that it costs you more money...",14
This course is not consistent with someone who would sign up for an entire certificate. This course is more suitable as a recruitment tool for a certificate program. Watching these videos was an absolute waste of my time.,14
Should this even be a course? Like they just say things that anyone can find the first thing on google if search you data science.,14
"Poor course overall, not much ""meat"". An introduction to the subject that could have been given in one hour of lessons. ",14
"useless, wasting time",14
"The course seems poorly pieced together with videos from Big Data University - which is now known as Cognitive Class. There is mainly little coherence into what the course is trying to teach in all the videos. Readings were given on a rather low resolution image file - that makes it difficult to read and kinda 1990s feel. Is it that difficult to save the pdf in text or include a higher res image file?Similar to the point that a data science report should indicate the details and affiliations of the person writing the report, many speakers in the videos apart from the two professors does not have any background information. Who are they? Where are they from? What background are they speaking from? All these are important context for learning. I did learn something from the final assignment though. However, that was personal reflection and learning from peers. Thinking whether I should continue with this course.",14
"Waste of time. Most of the material was ""fluff"" about data science. What was actually useful could have been accomplished with a 2-3 page pdf. Only finished it, because I'm taking it as part of the IBM specialization through my work. I REALLY hope the other courses are more useful and worth the time. Very disappointed in this course.",14
"A very basic and shallow introduction to data science. Too much hand-holding and too much time spent discussions of little value. Ideal for someone who is very young and very new to the field., everyone else should avoid it.",14
"This cannot be considered as  a course  it tells some general info about the experience of some professors but  nothing technical,  of course it's useful but it's not really worth it ",14
The course doesn't teaches anything except for explaining data science benefits and examples.,14
"I'm sorry to give a low rating, but this course is condescending.  Some of the statements are also opinions that contradict things you will hear in other courses, not to mention that a great part of the course is obvious, academic approaches and even how to structure a report like a thesis. This course added absolutely nothing to my knowledge. You're better off reading a recent blog post, or simply an introduction from a good book on applied ML/data science. ",14
This course is borderline insulting!The entire course content could be summaries on half A4 page.The video clips are interviews with people working in the field. the reading material either reiterate the video clip content or presents a new concept in an elementary school level.,14
I dont appreciate the Peer-graded assessment part. It is simply not acceptable to be reliant on other students for assessment. This is just lazy.,14
For what?,14
"i thought a lot of questions were subjective at aimed at the academic field. It neglected to refer to real world situations and jobs, which is where the majority of learners will surely be coming from. Probably a little bit my own perspective, but I dislike when Data Scientists big them up to be so much better than every other profession and separate themselves from statistics so much (it's part of statistics and should just be considered a branch of such in my opinion, not a separate profession). There was too much of it here.  ",14
"Very very superficial, most of the course material is about the profile, job and prospects of a data scientist. Hardly any of the content is about the actual science and technology. A few sketchy minutes are spent on Hadoop and deep learning, the rest is fluff. Waste of my time. Too bad, IBM is such a forefront player, I expected a lot more. ",14
Little value in terms of knowledge or skills for somebody paying for this course. Single Wiki document will cover the entire course content.,14
"Don't take it. No Course Instructors, no help. Not worth the money...Even the Working Platform is always timing out or has a gateway error.",14
"This is literally just hype for data science with no substance, include coding from day one or get real, I'm here to learn.",14
"In the peer graded assignments, there are always students intentionally click on the lowest score!",14
Didn't really learn anything but I guess it was a good gatekeeper.,14
IBM Cloud advertisement and nothing more.,14
Utter waste of time,14
"Extremely basic introductory course. Unfortunately you don't learn much about actual data science methods. Quiz questions tend to require you to memorize word for word quotations of supplied text, as opposed to challenging you to think about concepts. I would recommend this course for someone completely new to the idea of data science, but not to people who already know a bit.",14
"Completely waste of time! Very Disappointed with this course. This teaching method is completely inefficient. Some professional people will be interviewed and then you should answer quizzes after each video. It takes more than 3 hours to complete this course, however, all useful information could be provided in 5 slides and discuss them only for 20-30 minutes.",14
" [Reviewing the entire IBM Data Science specialization but points are applicable for
each course]I signed up for the
IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start
it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually
started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making
my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of
bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses
and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it
anymore. Here’s why:1. First and
foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at
least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other
students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me
but whatever, lets move on.2. The in-video
quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are
expected to have memorized content word by word rather than
understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of
the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.3. The final
assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which
IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing
stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.4. We eventually got
to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter
notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no
proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read
python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though
python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.5. And my final and
biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel
like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred
excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells
here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM
Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing
problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my
assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open
source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter
they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more
focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality
content.6. Now after
finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly
filled in basically letting them know their specialization if
terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent
them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this
course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to
IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfbI was very saddened
by the quality of the specialization and the content and was
wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses
but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out
it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would
recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting
next week.In conclusion, I got
this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to
say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated
by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their
courses.  ",14
"Be warned!!I took this course and completed then got my 'digital badge'.  However, for me and 100's of other students (according to the forums) our grades and progress disappeared.  Coursera, are telling students to report the issue but after 2 weeks and hundreds of complaints nothing has happened.The course itself is OK but when you are PAYING it is very poor support.",14
"Really disappointed with the whole specialisation... I am leaving this review here because probably you might not check the others courses before you start it. Specialisation is short and it is the only good thing about it. It took me I think 10-12 hours to do it.So first of all the whole thing is not really informative. A lack of videos - Most of the time there is only ""power-point""presentation with code written on it.  I don't really understand why they have narrator who just read text - no emotions almost like a machine.Courses:1. You will spend a lot of time learning listening to videos about how sexy is to be data scientist... and that parents start sending their daughters for data science (sic!), and that it is a new science... Plus some rather simple information which you rather know taking into consideration you want to study it online. At least it is nice to watch - there is life in it.2. You will spend the whole course watching different notebooks like jupyter R studio etc . without really learning any useful stuff. In the end you will just click run to create some already written commands in python. Yeap that's it.  I know it is intro but adding 1 +1 third time in different console... 3.  You will learn some methodology - A lot of complicated knowledge read by narrator who is not making it easier or more interesting. Almost like somebody reading you technical book...4. SQL - you will try to learn it from presentations. I think there are no proper videos just images in narrated power point presentation. I watched some coursera lectures about sql before but still I had problems with following it. To make it worst you will have to use IBM products which are FREE - other reviews are probably outdated. The problem is that materials from this course are also outdated. So they are presenting you IBM tool-set which is already different. It is a problem because they are not even trying to show how they work just where to click. I managed, you will too but, IBM, please do better.  ",14
"Hi,I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)Course 1: approximately 9 hours to completeCourse 2: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 3: approximately 9 hours to completeCourse 4: approximately 22 hours to completeCourse 5: approximately 14 hours to completeCourse 6: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 7: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 8: approximately 20 hours to completeCourse 9: approximately 47 hours to completeThis makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate.

"The course content is exciting and high level. In this course the student does not do any hands on data science, except the occasional introduction to an IBM tool. Instead, they are introduced to a broad range of topic, tools, and perspectives on data science. It is a good introduction to the subject, and I would likely have given this course three stars, maybe four, had there not been so many large bugs, that at the time of this writing, almost two weeks since posting in the Discussion Forums and contacting Coursera Help several times, has not been fixed.For anyone going into the course, please take screenshots of all quizzes and assignments you complete. If you experience the same issue I have, and hundreds of others are having, than your progress data may get erased. I should have received my badge for completing this course two weeks ago but it is still saying I have ""overdue"" items and that I've completed everything at the same time.I am sad to give this one start rating, but so it goes. I hope they fix this as soon as possible, and it may end up affecting people's billing.",14
"A complete waste of anyone's time who knows anything about data science and would seek the data science specialization on this site.  Further, the course material thus far appears to be a paid-for repackaging of free instructional materials offered by IBM at bigdatauniversity.com.  Why I had to sit through this material is beyond me in the context of a data science skills tract. Please, stop wasting professionals' precious time and money with this material.  This material took me merely a weekend to get through, not 3 weeks, the framing of which seems questionable at best.  Please remove this from the overall specialization.  My experiences thus far make me feel that I may not continue with this set of courses if this is the level of quality I can expect.",14
"I am subscribed to and paying for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and when I attempt to submit a quiz within the ""What is Data Science?"" course the submit button displays ""Upgrade to submit"". When I attempt to go through any of the customer service or chat windows which themselves are hard to find, the chat window does not display properly or function in the slightest. This was also the case when I attempted to submit a support request or create a ticket within the mobile app. Terrible and frustrating experience. At this point I'm unsure as to what to do besides cancel my subscription and give up on the money I have already payed as they seem to be instant on not allowing you to contact any customer service representatives.",14
"There should be an option to rate zero stars ! I am CS graduate, and also has deep understanding of learning algorithms. Isn't it's a huge waste of time, spending three weeks to recite the definition of data science and data scientist ? I believe most of the students in this course are somewhat from CS or equivalent background. And for them its just a trash!People, maybe high school kids may say oh no its such a good course, i never knew data can be such impactful bla bla bla, they might find this course little bit useful than just googling : ""what is data science ?""And the quizzes, lol that's just joke. You have to recite salary figures from supplementary pdf so it might make you feel good! who knows !",14
"Lost quizzes that I took multiple times, weeks after I'd completed the course and issued a certificate, Coursera web site now saying that I didn't complete it, and the certificate is missing.  Many others have posted in Coursera forums reporting the same issue.  We have reported to support and keep getting the same answer ""our team is working on it"".  No timeline for resolution, no updates on progress.  Nobody can complete the program and obtain the Data Science Professional certification if this class is not marked as complete.",14
"This is not a course. I was upset when a subscription was renewed and I immediately cancelled. I tried to get a refund but coursera would not allow. You will learn more from youtube. This is a gross waste of time and money, and goes on to show how superficial our fixation on certificates are. The course is an insult. I could have taught the three weeks on an A4 paper, instead of watching some uninspired students. ",14
"Don't pay for this course, it's useless. For example: What's Data Science? It's what data scientists do. And at the exam you should have answered exactly like that, even if you don't have any idea on what's the meaning of ""data"". And this should be a ""Professional"" certificate. Try to answer like that to someone about whatever question you can think of and they will burn you alive.",14
"Useless BS Fluff class. Make some of this optional reading in another class, but don't make is seem like it has any value. You risk loosing people in different cert programs. It makes a cert program look inflated, such as 9 classes...with this being one of them it's really only eight classes. Then you start with this BS and you question the value of the entire program.",14
"Too basic, useless and total waste of time and money. You get nothing out of this course except for some basic information about data science that you could have easily learned from various free online sources out there. I agree with other reviewers that the only purpose of this course is to drag out the certification process so that it costs you more money...",14
"During this course, be prepared to wade through the huge paragraphs of the text. There are not so many practical exercises, just two, so most of the time you will play the game is true-false. The final assignment is not much about practising big data or data science technologies. I hope there will be increasing of the number of practical tasks. ",14
"waste of my money. Did not learn anything new, may be good for people coming from non-technical background. Video snippets without much technical value or learning isn't of much value to me.The image recognition exercise is also not up to the mark in detecting parameters. I felt very disappointed and at loss with this course.",14
"i was charged for this course without any prior notification mine money was deducted from mine account when I requested for refund there was proper channel to place query regarding refund. coursera is just a fake they take money in the name of education , it was mine life biggest mistake to come here",14
"This is really bad, I completed this course last month, and got the badge, no my grades disappeared, with not answer from teaching staff or coursera support, I'm not the only one.I have to redo the course, due to the lack of support, I just want my professional certificate.",14
The quiz questions throughout the course seem to be asking the queston 'Have you studied?' instead of 'Did you learn the anything?'. This approach does not work well for me. I don't need to know the exact wording of a sentence to know if the meaning of it is correct.,14
This section of the course feels like a complete waste of time... Most people who have signed up for this program know what data science is and watching a bunch of random people give generic speeches about their opinion on it is boring and a waste of my time.,14
"There is nothing new I have learnt here., to know the definition of Data Science and its applications why would someone do a course of it, instead one can browse the definitions in Google search. It's just waste of money to invest in the course like this.",14
Not at all worth it. Just provides insights to the field  in layman terms  without actually providing  knowledge to a beginner.All the lessons in the course are just interviews with people.I do not recommend this course at all.Would have rated it 0.5/5,14
Self serving plug by the author to promote his book and his thesis work. There are much better coursesNote to Coursera: The slides and videos are outdated. There are a number of forum posts calling for help.Dismal experience. Worst course ever.,14
"Google Simulating Environment has the bugs and when you writing to Support, this rich guys stat you to do a free ""PROD"" testing : no way, it's theirs bugs, and I have my own. What the hell are paid for?Shame on YOU IBM for such solution!",14
My course progress was DELETED!!!!! I finished this a couple of weeks ago.  Once i completed the third course in the progression for Data Science Professional it didnt send me my badge and erased the progress for the first course!!!!,14
The information provided in this course is very superficial and very outdated. By reading the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page for Data Science you will learn more that if you complete this course. Very disappointing. ,14
"surprisingly lazy and unnecessary course, that brave enough.where other stupidoes goes with 1-2 inspirational videos about data science, IBM did freaking 3-week course about these videos. skip this, you won't need it. ",14
"I expected to get a certificate for the one course I did. They did not provide for that, and despite for asking for a separate payment for every course, they denied on giving separate certificates for the same!",14
There is no option for me to complete the course after missing the assignment submission. There is no proper support available they give the support link but no support rep to talk for resolving any issue.,14
"IBMCloud platform it uses to buggy to be used as tool to teach, error messages from the tool not helpful and I spent time on the ibmcloud errors then on the actual course. Would not recommend to anyone.",14
"They need to have a better approach for certain assignments, forcing you to wait for another person to complete an assignment just so you can complete a peer review is a incredibly frustrating.",14
" I cant believe you guys charge real fucking money for this fucking youtube video of a course. I could easil learn more, and with way more in depth and precise info, from a crappy youtube video. ",14
poorly organized weak content. This course has a extremely light workload that can be finished in a couple of hours. Looks stupid to lock the students from taking the assignments for 2 weeks.,14
"I have completed this course and got the certificate ad teh badges , and now showing me it never been taken ...! Could any one fix this that and add the course back to my learning path ...!",14
Its looks more like an interview than a course. Many people talking. I feel like instead of learning i am hearing to varied views and get confused. I can search in google for peoples views.,14
"Curso de pocas horas que simplemente te da una definición de ciertos conceptos básicos.Esperaba más por la calificación media del curso, la estimación de la duración y por el Instructor.",14
"If you are not familiar with any topic or wording in data science then this is the course for you. Unfortunately, there was no real technical learning about data science in this course. ",14
This is hands down the worst course on data sciences I've ever seen. StatQuest with Josh Starmer's youtube channel is a way better use of time. As is any economics textbook. ,14
"lots of information that are not well explained for beginners in Data Science.I also tried to drop the course but could not do it, as no help is provided for such action!!!",14
Quite useless course. It goes around the topic of data science but gives no skills on it. Hope next courses in specialization are going to be more specific and hands-on,14
"Not sure why this is a course. You get the same level of introduction from youtube videos, which of course are free. This should have been a ""week"" in a later course.",14
"I thought most of it was a waste of time. I didn't learn much from the readings, and I thought all of the quizzes and in-video questions were redundant and useless. ",14
"was unable to claim by badge due to email issue while creating acclaim account. It is being displayed that my account was already taken, hope u go through my issue",14
This course and the whole specialization track is available for free on cognitive class.. And the badge issued by cognitive class doesn't say powered by coursera,14
This course was horrid.  What a total waste of my money.  I learned absolutely nothing.  It was nothing like the course description.  I feel totally ripped off.,14
Complete waste of time unless you've lived under a rock for the last 10 years and never even heard the words data and science mentioned in the same sentence.,14
"I see one week as an introduction is enough, but spending the 3 weeks in that no need details - as concept is considered already in mind - was so unhelpful.",14
Extremly basic and recovers ground repeatidly with fairly generic discussion. I understand it tries to set the scene but not worth 3 weeks of your time. ,14
I finished this course months ago and now its incomplete. I am angry that I possibly have to retake it again especially when I just finished. ,14
This first class is Coursera's TRICK to issue me a certificate so user's can not cancel for free. I consider this move very sneaky. ,14
This course is just a short review of what data science is. You could watch a YouTube video about DS and save the money.,14
Sad. Made me create accounts in their products. id rather learn online for free. Ashamed of the OBM name now. Seriously.,14
my curiosity  about Data science is not less even after going through and watching available resources in Coursera.,14
Trying to login Watson Studio for 2 days . There is no help or assistance tab from coursera  to solve this issue. ,14
The lectures are vague to incomprehensible. The assignments use no critical thinking whatsoever. Don't bother.,14
"it is too much of a marketing event for IBM, not a scientific course or university level. very disappointing",14
"I did not benefit much, its called a ""course"" but its not more than descriptive talking nothing scientific.",14
Very disappointed. Unnecessary introduction. Should get straight into data science material and subjects.  ,14
i submitted all my assignments on time and was not graded on my final. giving me a 78 final grade overall,14
"This did not need to be an entire course, it does not have enough substance to be a stand-alone course.",14
There is no  much practical side for this course except to make pre built  classification tool using ,14
this course is purely informative and loads of talk which has zero value in upscaling your skill.,14
you can probably learn everything that is taught in this class in a few hours of web browsing,14
Might be of interest for very beginners but nothing you cannot learn from reading online.,14
Useless course with theory. not really much helpful in term of learning and skill.,14
The final peer reviewed assignment is a complete waste of time and resources.,14
The interface is quite confusing. comparing to LinkedIn Learning interface.,14
The way they handle the final assignment is disappointing to say the least,14
They removed the availability of the courses for the student program >:(,14
I learned nothing. This course is just a group of useless definition.,14
They will steal 35euro from you without teaching anything relevant,14
Not a very useful course. It seemed more like an advertisement.,14
More like a marketing stint than an actual data science course,14
Just a lot of talk. Might as well have youtubed that question.,14
Didn't learn anything new. Could have just skipped this step.,14
"Very basic, very slow. Could be summarised in a 5 min video. ",14
There is a little amount of content in too many videos,14
Not much useful and easy to understand for beginners,14
This course does not give  as such meaningful info.,14
Too general...only take if you have zero knowledge,14
"there is no turkish subtitle, are you guys liar ?? ",14
very surfacy introduction and not enough contents ,14
"Should be more detailed and lengthy, very basic",14
I thought It was for advanced Data scientists,14
this is a beta topic explained in alpha ways.,14

Too basic and a lot of repetitive content.,14
Not useful information and it took time.,14
Keep trying to unenroll won't let me,14

I am amazed that IBM even put this course out on Coursera. It is the worst course I have come across. It is a humongous waste of time. It supposedly introduces the IBM Watson Studio but ALL the videos are outdated and do not reflect the platform currently on IBM's website. It is impossible to follow the instructions. You just have to sign up to the platform and hobble along trying to make sense of it. The quizzes were a utter waste of time. They don't even reflect the content in the videos. Many of the questions had topics that were not even covered. I was unable to do the final assignment because it's impossible to get to the Jupyter notebooks page when you sign in. It was an incredibly frustrating experience. I wasn't alone - the discussion forums are filled with hundreds of comments on the same issue - not being able to find the webpage where they need to create a notebook and do the assignment. I did not see any of the moderators even bothering to reply. Why have you put this course out here if you have no interest in providing quality content or help when your content is utterly outdated. I question IBM's reputation. This is a shambles of a course that I actually paid for (still paying since they changed it to a monthly debit!). I am in two minds whether to even continue with this certificate - seems ,33
"                  YOU LEARN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! One star it's even too much. You learn how to make accounts on the IBM's proprietary platform so that you can pay one day (there is a monthly limit about the stuff you can do and if you don’t pay you are screwed). Giving away all your private data, of course. A platform that for free gives you the computing power of a 15 years old machine (with many other drawbacks). Jupyter Notebooks, R, Scala, it's all out there without Watson Studio, you could have installed Anaconda for example with all the beauty and speed of your personal machine (who doesn't have at least a dual core nowadays?). Without considering that would have been a lot more useful. So, you will learn only which open source tools you could use, but they send you on a proprietary platform to do that, without teaching you anything about those tools. Wait, they ask you to write 1 + 1 on python when you take the exam, you are all set with data science. This is a shame!    ",33
"The experience of using IBM Watson really sucks! Tons of problems just kept poping out all the way from creating accounts to using notebook. And these problems have been existing for months, which is really shameful. Hope there's somebody can fix these problems right away.",33
"The entire section is without any introductions, any explanations. The services described in the video and actual (revised) versions don't line up. Instructor is just a useless, read-it-on guy that doesn't add anything to the learning experience. Overall, useless crap.",33
"Altough it may be understandable, this is just ads for IBM's products. So it's like if I paid to see ads.",33
This course is useless. I spent several days watching videos and reading the materials only to get stuck in the end with no help in sight. Dozens of students are in the forums asking for help but even the instructor couldn't help us with the watson studio software. ,33
"instead of 5 minute snippets of a handful of data science tools, it would have been more practical to focus on one and spend some time on it...i'm really disappointing in this series",33
Links are out of date,33
useless and non-up-dated,33
"Please make this lesson easier to understand. The tutorials regarding how to use the open source tools are also out of date which makes the lesson very confusing. I had to do additional research on youtube, which I honestly found more valuable than this course. ",33
" [Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for
each course]I signed up for the
IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start
it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually
started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making
my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of
bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses
and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it
anymore. Here’s why:1. First and
foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at
least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other
students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me
but whatever, lets move on.2. The in-video
quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are
expected to have memorized content word by word rather than
understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of
the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.3. The final
assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which
IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing
stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.4. We eventually got
to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter
notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no
proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read
python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though
python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.5. And my final and
biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel
like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred
excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells
here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM
Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing
problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my
assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open
source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter
they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more
focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality
content.6. Now after
finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly
filled in basically letting them know their specialization if
terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent
them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this
course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to
IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfbI was very saddened
by the quality of the specialization and the content and was
wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses
but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out
it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would
recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting
next week.In conclusion, I got
this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to
say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated
by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their
courses.  ",33
"This course is an absolute catastrophe and I look forward to moving on to the next one. The first 2 weeks are a giant collection of endless software lists. Rather, I would have liked to see a disciplined presentation of the data science process itself (aka Course 3 of the certificate) and then only the softwares. The only useful piece is the chart presenting the steps of the data process. The rest is purely inadequate at this stage, I am sorry. The course jumps back and forth from the very easy/trivial to the downright specific/complicated without any inbetween. Why mention Kubernetes, gateways, runtimes, PMML and other endless jargon when people don't have a clue where these fit in the bigger picture ? Instead of presenting 68 different softwares and acronyms, I believe it would be more valuable to present Jupyter Notebooks properly, from scratch and focusing on its foundational features. That would be 2-3 hours well invested. One last note: the ""Free Python 3.6"" environment (using zero machine unit) is not available anymore. I had to create a separate environment manually, with 1 CPU and 4Gb RAM (using 0.5 u/hour) as a second best alternative. ",33
"This course is embarrassing to take, the level of education is so that a highschooler would understand it with ease, it does not teach you how to use the tools claimed. Advertising this course as a learning tool to open source tools for DS, is akin to someone advertising a course for programming languages then teaching you how to write hello world in two or three languages. A more apt name for the course is ""An outdated advertisement to IBM tools for data science"". Why do I suddenly mention outdated? Because the videos, labs, and readings use the IBM skills academy website as is at least a year outdated, the tools they use (specifically adding data to the skills lab) are no longer available, and the instructors have done nothing about this on the forums. You're better off learning from youtube or google or anywhere else, even if this course was free, it'd be a rip-off.",33
"I enjoyed the first part of the specialization and was all set to pay to subscribe for the remaining 9 courses.  Open Source tools for Data Science is an absolute mess though.  From the first chapter, the resources are littered with spelling errors.  Mini-quizzes pop up during videos asking questions on content which hasn't yet been covered.  The labs are vague and make little sense, and then to top it off, Week 3 has a lab and video tutorial for a totally outdated version of Watson Studio which looks nothing like the current version and is impossible to follow along with.I've now unsubscribed from this course.  I'll come back to it if and when it's updated.",33
"I have coding experience for more than 6 years in my field and I do have a Ph.D.; I do not mean that I am smart, I just mean I am used to learning on myself as well as teaching programming (Java) to beginners! The course, tools for data science, seems there is no thinking in the teaching material! what a beginner level means and what are the teaching tools and requirement are! Directly to a terminal in Linux and start doing things that definitely need an intro and some pre actions! What a waste of time! If there was a zero star, I could give one! ",33
"Imagine that you weren't particularly handy, but on a whim you decided to build yourself a dog house.  You go to the hardware store, and the guy behind the counter tells you to start with the hydraulic maintenance manual for a multi-million dollar crane used on skyscrapers.  That is the best analogy I can give you for the utter uselessness of this course.I'm plunging ahead with the next course, but I have to say my opinion of IBM is diminishing with every step forward.",33
"Terrible course. I hope the other courses in this certificate program are better. If they are anything like this I would certainly expect people to start asking for their money back. Romeo Kienzler might be very knowledgeable, but he clearly cannot teach well online. The videos were low quality, with bad audio, and taught you next to nothing. Very disappointing. ",33
Really bad narration as well as unclear instruction. This course makes me rethink if I should continue.,33
"The videos and explanations are not great If you are a beginner, do not take this course.",33
"It's terrible, useless and boring",33
The course materials are extremely outdated and due to this reason I've spent way to much time trying to figure out how to set up my notebook. IBM Watson is just not user friendly and not easy to navigate at all and the basics were not covered anywhere. It just shows that you don't care at all.This is very unprofessional and I am seriously considering dropping out of the remaining courses from this professional certificate and I am definitely not recommending any IBM courses to anybody. I would give it -5 starts if possible. ,33
"The videos aren't updated. They are using an old version of the IBM cloud and IBM watson studio. It is extremely difficult to follow the tutorials based on. You should find the recent information through the forums and Google, which is ok. But, why is the idea of having a video that is not useful with the current platform?",33
"Watson and Skill Net are massively complex tools that are hard to use or initiate. That one needs to study these tools for the sake of just using them is a caveat. These tools will go away / be superseded by something else, and this study time is lost. Hope to get some deeper understanding of Data Science soon..",33
"A gigantic advertisement of IBM Watson Studio.Not only that, but the studio itself does not function properly.Some of the videos were made by an IBM professional in his car!!! Honestly, you can see him on his webcam...I found not more than 20% of the course useful.A waste of time and money! ",33
"The course is way too basic to pay for it, you can get better value for your money somewhere else. I had too many issues with Watson Studio and the support I received from the tutor/assistants was repetitive and not helpful. ",33
"The videos about GitHub were lack of pedagogy. fast, not clear and the subtitles in most of the cases did not match.",33
"Hi,I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)Course 1: approximately 9 hours to completeCourse 2: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 3: approximately 9 hours to completeCourse 4: approximately 22 hours to completeCourse 5: approximately 14 hours to completeCourse 6: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 7: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 8: approximately 20 hours to completeCourse 9: approximately 47 hours to completeThis makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate. As there are 9 courses, each course takes approximately 19 hours (=169/9) to complete.(*):  https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&campaignid=1876641588&utm_content=10-IBM-Data-Science-US&adgroupid=70740725700&device=c&keyword=ibm%20data%20science%20professional%20certificate%20coursera&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=347453133242&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0Mb3BRCaARIsAPSNGpWPrZDik6-Ne30To7vg20jGReHOKi4AbvstRfSbFxqA-6ZMrPn1gDAaAiMGEALw_wcB ",33
"I appreciate the efforts that were put together in the course, and I have had very good experience with IBM courses in the past. However, was a bit disappointed with this one. The videos for IBM Watson Lab were outdated, which resulted in a lot of wastage of time to submit the final assignment*. Also, it does not make sense for students to compulsory learn IBM software and use it for assignments. Basically had to learn an extra software which we did not even sign up for. As part of IBM professional certificate, I think it was a bit redundant and can easily be made part of a Python beginner or Data Science beginner course. *Faculty were helpful to point this out and point a step by step procedure for the updated version. But this was in the discussion section, and also immediately makes having watched the videos completely futile. ",33
"The worst course of the IBM Data Science Certificate. It does not have the typical quality standards of an IBM course:- The explanation is very poor, disorganised and very below IBM qualities (even below basic standards)- Some videos have terrible audio because they are made in the instructor's car- The teaching lacks consistency and logic: for example, (1) the instructor uses SHH keys but he explains how to make an SHH Key only 2 videos after (he says ""I'll tell you how do it later""...); (2) Staging is not mentioned during the videos, but it is requested during the test for week 2 GitHub.- The instructor takes way too many things for granted.- Too many topics done in a very superficial wayDo not attend the course if you are not obliged (you are studying for the IBM data science certificate)",33
"For the people who is interesting about taking this course , I will share my real opinions in order not to waste their time and money. 1) This course has not been designed to teach you something it is more about the IBM services. 2) Do not expect that something will be explained in more detial. 3) Especially who does not have any programming background will not understand anything at a specific part of course. 4)  Especially during the second week, everything that a person explained in the videos were usefullness becuase if you do not know how to write a code there will be no meaning for you. Even if you know how do coding the sequence or the topics which explained during the 2nd week were just nothing ( no meaning). I can tell a lot about the course. BUT COMPLETELY NOT RECOMMENDED",33
"HORRIBLE course. Outdated and boring tutorial videos where you learn nothing except to know the existence of IBM tools that I suppose IBM is trying to promote through this course. The videos were made in 2016 and are completely outdated so you can't follow any of the instructions. The tools themselves are extremely buggy: out of 10 clicks, 6 will end up in an error message. They are not intuitive either. There's no way those tools are used in professional environments.The 5 stars reviews must be fake reviews from IBM staff. There is no way any genuine student would give 5 stars to such a crappy course.Look at the forums' comments and complaints before paying for this.Really shocked that Coursera allowed such bad courses on its platform.",33
"I don't think this course is any good at all. It crams all the different workstations at you giving you tasks to do in each one. Without actually  building projects or seriously using these workstations, by the time you need to use them for a project the retention on how do navigate and use them are going to be low. I have totally forgotten how to use RStudio and what Spark is and I am on course 5 of the IBM cert because it hasn't been used since this course. I believe in a stand-a-lone when I need to refresh, this will be good to go back to but seems kind of pointless in the beginning of the Data Science IBM cert.",33
"Probably one of the least necessary courses in this program. Every video felt like an infomercial explaining all of the tools' features, and alternative tools. I understand having a weeks worth of content for this course, but 4 weeks is excessive. There are many many tools in the realm of data science and as long winded as this was it still did not touch the surface of all them. It also felt like IBM was really trying to push watson studio and their internal tools on me as the viewer.  I see the intent, but this course should be reduced to the MOST commonly used tools and keep it focused on that. ",33
"The only objective of this course is to push IBM Cloud and Watson Studio on the learners. The software is highly dysfunctional and user unfriendly. I can't submit my assignment due to unclear instructions and errors that come up when I try to do so. This is so far the worst part of this whole course. I have found a forum link with some troubleshooting which I have fruitlessly searched for an answer, maybe somebody will find something there: https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science/peer/xakrA/create-and-share-your-jupyter-notebook/discussions/threads/G7ITBorwEem4khKVBn768g",33
"I regret the low review, but this course needs A LOT of work. Instruction is poorly formatted and (seemingly) lazily and sporadically delivered. This is supposed to be a beginner level course with no prerequisites, however, I wonder if newcomers to the course (and this cert overall) should be equipped with some other courses or specializations/certificates before entering this one. Thank you nonetheless for your effort, and I hope you can improve your material in the future after the chaos of the pandemic (and all the pressure it has most surely placed on you) has subsided.Kind regards.",33
"I enjoyed the hands-on lab work. Unfortunately, the instructions given in writing and in the videos are outdated regarding IBM Watson Studio, and this led to a lot of frustration and wasted time trying to click around and search for the correct instructions on my own. There were also many typos in one of the written lessons, and the quizzes didn't always match the material addressed corresponding lesson (or, in one case, the quiz question popped up before the topic was addressed in the video). While I'm grateful for the lab work, this was not a good educational experience.",33
"I do not recommend this course; however, as it's part of the Data Science Certificate it's unavoidable. The course is basically an introduction to an IBM online software that lets you use R, Python, etc. without having to download them. That's fine, but it could realistically be done in about five minutes instead of the two hours the course takes to complete. My advice is either don't take this class if you aren't going for the Certificate, or go through it as fast as possible if you are going for the Certificate. This course was a waste of time.",33
"I hate to give this comment. Poor quality videos and study material. Not simply it misstated the fact that this is a Beginner course, there is also lack of effort in each of the videos made, making beginner very difficult to follow due to frequent switch of screens, making corrections in the video... The Reading/Lab section is also not helpful in terms of giving clear instructions. I only understood 10% of the materials from this course and learned everything else by myself on Youtube and other sources. The videos definitely need to be remade.  ",33
"This course is a huge disappointment. It is more of a promo of IBM Watson Studio than an actual class. It would be much more useful to make a course about the Anaconda framework, which is a useful desktop framework that I believe many data scientists actually use.The Watson Studio does not seem to be that good either. It is not exactly intuitive and it takes some getting used to before you can navigate through it. The instruction videos and pictures in the lectures do not help much since they are out of date. It is slow too. ",33
"Program information advises that this course is ideal for beginners with no prerequisites required.  This is absolutely 'false'.  Week 2 of the program is most certainly about programming, writing code, utilizing Git/Github and a video with an instructor going 90 miles an hour offering instructions on creating a new project that was totally confusing which lead to my decision to cancel my subscription of this course. Refer to Week 2 Discussion Forum for comments of other participants. Very disappointed.  ",33
"Videos seem to be copied in from third parties. They do not have a logical progression and often overlap.Many instances of the video showing an obsolete version of the software to the point that it is impossible to follow the instructions given, and the students must scour the forums or google to find their own solutions. This type of learning is not worth paying for.Exercises were not educational. My only takeaway from this course was one sentence summarizing the tools given and markdown shorthand.",33
"Very poorly organized. I was taken straight to the video section at the beginning of this course. Unfortunately, the videos dive right into coding in Python, even though the first course in this series had never discussed Python!Also, the quizes do a poor job of educating someone like me who is new to Data Science. Important subjects are skimmed through in a very ad hoc fashion, and then the quiz begins, but you cannot reference the notes that cover that quiz. Overall, very poor course design. ",33
"As an introductory course, (which it is supposed to be) this course is awful.The videos consist of large amounts of technical jargon that are not understandable to someone who is a beginner.  There is very little explanation of why or how something is being done. Many of the instructions have not been updated for the most recent version of the tools .There are many, many, many confused people on the message boards over the last few months, yet nothing has been done to correct it.",33
"The videos are outdated for several months now. The content must've been good before, but now it is useless considering Watson Studio has been updated radically.We're paying real non refundable money for something like this! This is not acceptable. This issue has also been raised in the discussion forums but nothing has changed. I have been digging in the forums trying to follow the course but It is impossible to !! I feel cheated, and so will you, if you enroll here!!",33
"This certification track is complete garbage!   The first course was superficial definitions of Data Science - I can look all that up on my own!   The second course was very sloppy with the instructions, the screen shots did NOT match what I saw on Watson studio, when I reached out for help, the instructors response was totally unhelpful.  Coursera needs to either revamp this course or cancel it!   This was a huge waste of time and money! ",33
"Very poor at the moment. Week 2 Rstudio section has a downloadable map, after lots of work I did manage to do a workaround to get the zip file but then it couldn't be loaded. Equally and worse Week 3 covers Watson Studio, this has changed from Data Science Experience; the blurb says that its just a name change but thats not correct and I wasted hours trying to follow the instructions from the old layout through to the new layout. ",33
"Video tutorials are outdated, based on the old interface of IBM tools. Teachers are not giving instructions how to get some of the tools like Jupyter notebook of RStudio, they don't say which libraries needs to be installed before doing exercise and finally they don't show the full code which they're running. Overall it's a presentation of IBM products and those two open source products mentioned above, with a bit of GitHub. ",33
This course was a big disappointment.  this professional certificate is supposed to be for beginners with no prior knowledge. You keep explaining very advanced features and services like ssps modeler which I think something related to neural networks and for me as a Bonner I don't know anything about it. unfortunately this course makes a learner who is excited to learn frustrated and lost,33
"This course was awful, just a bunch of useless speeches, limited or no information about the workbenches, explaining only how to save a file or how to upload a file - maybe 5-6 times I have heard instruction about saving your work. Who does not recognise save icon nowadays? Who needs these instructions? Only coding so far lear, 1 + 1 equal to 2.... Course 2 was just a waste of time.",33
"One big course full of clickbait and needless and useless cloud services requiring you to give out information. There is not a single thing to learn about data science in this course. I've spent the last 2 hours jumping through the hoops of the companies endorsed in the course and so far I'm getting errors left and right, preventing me from completing this course. ",33
"This course is really disappointing. This was supposed to be a beginner level but it is not actually. Someone has to have a clear knowledge about Python, RStudio, machine learning, AI etc beforehead to actually understand this course. I continued for 2 weeks the gave up because it is not worth it!Really did not expect this from platform like coursera and IBM.",33
"The course should be improved, as all resources that it references to were significantly changed. At the moment I do not see any benefits of continuing the whole IBM Data Science set of courses, as I anticipate that the next 7 courses are at the same ""not up to date""  level. It's sad as I have to search for better knowledge sources. ",33
"This is not a beginner course. At all. The instructions skip over multiple steps to the point where you have look up half of everything yourself. Which is not why I paid for this course. To be clear, this has been an issue in both of the IBM's Data Science Professional courses I've begun. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU'RE A BEGINNER",33
"Absolute waste of money and time. The videos are outdated and can not be followed. The quizzes are totally irrelevant. The videos will make you sign up with lots of IBM services and won't teach you anything about it. Totally frustrating experience and it was the worst ""course"" I've ever experienced in my life. Wouldnt recommend.",33
"The course felt poorly structured. Quizes ask questions that have not been covered yet. Have had to use a lot of secondary resources, googling,  to understand terms. The videos would reference tabs that didn't actually exist in the jupyter workbooks. All in all a rather unsatisfactory experience compared to the first course. ",33
"I'm sorry but I felt like there was not much guidance in using the tools you introduced us to. I was able to get 100% on all my tests while not being able to press single button on apache zeppelin - still completely don't know how to use this program. Your links don't work, videos are outdated and forum doesn't help either.",33
"During the final portion of this course, it got confusing and their was no one to help.  I stumbled throw this course.  Even when I tried to email or text or go to the discussion page, no one to help me.  I am not sure I want to go any further using your course.  I guess it's like the old saying ""You get what you pay for"".  ",33
"No puedo calificarlo bien, por mas que quice hacerlo . Si hablas español es mejor no cintinuar el curso, puesto que el Programa Watson studio está muy desfasado en actualizaciones de una región a otra He batallado mucho en enviar tareas etc .  al final me decidí por otro curso en ésta plataforma ",33
"A very bad course!!!Extremely disappointed  by this course. It was meant to be for beginners, but the explanation was not understandable for beginners. Even the videos were very short and didn't explain some of the very basic parts. Worst experience I every had with any of the coursera courses.",33
Not very useful at all. Basically just a marketing campaign for IBM. The fact that they dare charge for this course or any of the other in this specialization is outrageous. Most of the content is outdated and the tools they force you to use have been updated so the content is not aligned.,33
Coursera needs to update the material and almost all of the videos. It is frustrating and time-consuming to figure things out on IBM Watson Studio when the instructions are non-existent. You need to go through the forums and discussion-threads to figure out how the Jupyter notebooks work. ,33
"No Submissions AvailableThere are no submissions available for you to review right now. Come back later if you want to review more classmates' submissions!How to start next section when being held up by cousera.I am busy, have limited time to study, this is not productive work flow.",33
"Video and audio are out of sync. Very little knowledge or skills value. Blank or misleading Quiz questions, misleading instructions, obvious IBM advertisement and account-herding practices. Quite disappointed, for paid offer unacceptable. Hope next courses will be much more useful.",33
"This material is not very useful. Although, it presents IBM Watson as a very productive and interesting tool for data science, the videos, readings, and exercises are not very helpful. It lacks of explanation and are not clear enough and make tedious the use of IBM Watson. ",33
"You can't just put down some videos and call it a course. Also, naming tools like there is no tomorrow doesn't mean the course is good. This is most likely the worst online course I've ever had a chance to be a part of and would not recommend it to anyone. Waste of time.",33
"Unfortunatelly, the course materials are deprecated. The videos need to be reviewed. Also, there should be more videos and more content to work in the Notebooks. I think the course should be moved to a point where the student already knows some programming to be useful.",33
"The course introduces three notebooks to the student, however, it fails to show the student how to use them. The answers to various questions were not explained in the videos and most of the videos are outdated. I do not feel like I have taken much from this course. ",33
"This course is seriously broken.  The last section of the course requires you to use cloud.ibm.com, but the applications referenced have been significantly changed, and do not work as described.  Until this is significantly revised, this course cannot be completed.",33
"Week 2's content, specifically the Zeppelin Notebook section was down for weeks and no one from Coursera even addressed the issue. Meaning I passed a course that's meant to give me at least a little experience with Zeppelin Notebooks, without ever using one.",33
Cannot follow the course because the IBM tool has changed the process and the course materials are outdated!Wasted so much time reading the forum to try figure out. This is not productive learning time. This is stupid time that comes from a outdated course,33
"The videos no longer match the cloud/site.The videos are no help because of that and because they go too fast, without a chance to follow along on the cloud/site.  Of course they need to update first.I got so frustrated I left the entire specialization.",33
"All the assignments stays locked. I tried changing the timeline also, nothing works. Thanks to this course my specialization remained uncompleted. The staff managing the course is doing a great job. Thanks to you, I wont be able to get a certification.",33
I would not recommend the IBM data science certificate course for beginners as there is no support from IBM and they seem to be keener on the paid their subscriptions. HarvardX courses are less complicated than this and have no conflict of interest.,33
The videos shown are obsolete and learners are having diffi ulty completingg dinal assignment because of this...IBM cloud is impossible to use....so stressfull especially because there is no one to talk to about this....you r basically on your own,33
"The labs were very poorly explained, with limited explanations and no clarity on the purposes for the lines of code. I struggled to instal and use most of the software because the instructions were not clear enough. I was extremely disappointed.  ",33
"The course links are outdated, course provided online tools doesn't work properly i could not even access the lab environments mentioned in the course since there was issues with the website i simply cannot recommend the course based on that.",33
Zepplin notebooks were not accessible.RStudio was accessible sometimes.TUtorial on watson studio was very different from the actual interface of watson studio.The course is actually not updated along with the watson studio and other tools.,33
"Google Simulating Environment has the bugs and when you writing to Support, this rich guys stat you to do a free ""PROD"" testing : no way, it's theirs bugs, and I have my own. What the hell are paid for?Shame on YOU IBM for such solution!",33
I thought that the course was premature. It would be nice to learn about the tools after some background in data science and than I would get actual experience with those tools. But unfourtunatly at this stage I think it was premature.,33
Very outdated course. Atleast they could have updated the videos to match with entirely new layout of IBM Watson Studios or Cognitive Class Lab. Even the information provided was very minimal with proper background or context to them,33
"Many video contents are out of date which making confusions to learner, i.e. Data Science Experience now change to IBM Watson Studio, but they do not update the video contents accordingly. It then very hard for learner to follow. ",33
"The content was okay but there were a lot of technical support problems. Apparently the IBM cloud infrastructure is in transition. Also, as the course admits, some of the videos use old terminology. This just needs to be fixed. ",33
"It seems that the real purpose of this course is to promote IBM's merchandise, not propagate knowledge. Because of this, there is lot of 'What is the different between ordinary XXX and IBM-provided XXX"" kind of junk in it. ",33
Useless course as far as familiarizing oneself with data science tools. It's simply a promotion of IBM's proprietary platform. And owing to the frequent technical problems and outdated instructions it fails even at that!,33
Trying to create a Jupyter notebook in IBM Watson for two days now as asked by the final assignment. The interface in the video is outdated and I'm really confused about how to create this simple assignment in Watson. ,33
"Course videos are out of date. The entire third week is dedicated to IBM Data Science Experience, which has been removed and replaced by IBM Watson Studio. Not much point to a walkthrough when you can't follow along.",33
"This course is not about tools for Data Science and how to use it, but about two services provided by IBM which have, among others, some tools used for data science (not explained in depth, but asked for, here)",33
"This is a waste of time.The course introduces various tools for data science. However, the majority of the focus was on IBM's products which leads to frustration. I'm surprised this course is offered by IBM. ",33
"Some instructors' videos are not clear with strong accent. And, final assignment does not match learning material which made it very complicated to complete. Hard to register IBM account for watson studio.",33
This course was at some extent confusing especially when I was learning about Watson Studio.It needs to be updated because the videos and its subtitle are still following the old DSX  environment.Thank you,33
"The information is given in such a boring matter that it's impossible to keep your attention long enough not to fall asleep. I have completed other courses in Coursera, and haven't had this issue before.",33
The course material (the videos) do not match with what IBM Watson Studio offers online. I wasted a lot of time to figure out some technical details which is not clear in your videos. So I gave up... ,33
The course study material is outdated and there is no support for the issued faced during the assignment. I am unable to complete the the assignment and have to move forward without the certificate.,33
"The course needs more instructions on the basic and more study materials. As the course suggests, you do not need programming background, but it was taught like one understands the basics and more. ",33
"al comienzo dicen que es para principiantes pero las explicaciones están por la mitad,  y cuando realmente un principiante quiere aprender se ve atorado con el contenido por que es muy técnico.",33
The information was random and did not match up with the videos. This was not taught as a beginner's class. The instructions were unclear; was missing parts and needed a lot of clarification . ,33
The topics are not covered from the base which makes it difficult for the beginners. Further the videos on the application are very poor as they are all out dated. Kindly update the videos. ,33
"Awful course. IBM Watson Studio, the platform where you are supposed to do the final assignment, doesn't work properly and nobody cares. There are no instructors or moderators on the forum.",33
"As someone who knows data science, I didn't find the course useful at all. They explain some technology but don't go too into detail about anything and it seems like a wasted opportunity. ",33
the lectures should be understandle to the beginners but these lectures will undertand to those who have already know those things please chnage and make videos understand to beginners,33
Course content is not up to date. It was very frustrating and time-consuming trying to create a project and finding menus that are actually not on the current version of IBM Watson. ,33
"I am writing this review when doing the final project, it's a good course but only 60 percent the rest of them is to advertise featuring for IBM Cloud Service, which is super slow. ",33
"No actual teaching or lectures. Just pointless 4-minutes videos which introduce assignments that you figure out on your own. Terrible course, terrible specialization from IBM.",33
"I have taken many courses in Coursera, but this one is horrible. It is very unorganized. The material is repetitive and not up-to-date.It has been a waste of money and time.",33
"The essence of this course can be fit into a one 10-15 mins youtube video. While the contents can be somewhat useful, the course itself is a complete waste of time and money",33
"Videos are really outdated, you should please update the videos with the current version of IBM Watson Studio. It had wasted a lot of time for me to figure out the stuff.",33
"Did I pay for an IBM advertisement? Seems like so. Furthermore, the videos in the lessons are obsolete and refer to a version of IBM Watson that is no longer available.",33
I can't open IBM cloud in China. It took like half an hour to just login the website. It's really annoying bc the final assignment was required to use the IBM platform. ,33
"Everything in this course feels like it stars in the middle, no explanation of anything. The course doesn't have any flow just random videos shown one after the other. ",33
ibm watson studio tutorial needs an update.. I found tutorial bit difficult because the ibm watson studio was in its updated version but tutorial wasn't updated..,33
"The videos are outdated, and the final assignment cannot be done due to technical issues. The instructor is not responsive to questions in the comment section.",33
"outdated. UI of the program has completed changed, and the instruction is still in the old way. I wasted so much time on finding out how to use the program. ",33
"Very useless course. The material would be best learned along with one of the languages. Instead, this is a glorified advertisement for IBM Watson Studio.",33
"Outdated, mostly ads for the used services.You could learn all the information provided in this course in under half an hour just by reading.",33
"The course is not really well organized. Furthermore, the videos are deprecated wrt the open sources they refer to. I wouldn't recommend it!",33
"Don't take it. No Course Instructors, no help. Not worth the money...Even the Working Platform is always timing out or has a gateway error.",33
The course is good but Video files should have been upgraded for a new product. It make students that have poor IT background be confused.,33
module 2 and 3 are far too complicated and monotonous for absolute beginners of data science. cancelling my subscription for the same.,33
"Material not updatedProject does not seem to workout as explained, HTML content does not show up on browser when you share the link",33
terrible. Can't believe I need to pay for this because this was simply only a matter of ads for IBM and it gave me nothing to do.,33
"The platforms are not ready. Instructions are outdated. Just familiarized with possible platforms, didn't learn anything useful. ",33
Very difficult to follow without any previous programming experience. Would put this course after in-depth programming courses. ,33
i was unable to access IBM Watson facility to perform practicals and with this i also unable to attend my PEER GRADE assignment,33
"What does this course aim to achieve, this course will definitely scare any beginner off from data science. Serves no purpose",33
Cours are not updated and maintained for new updates for the tools and it is frustrating to navigate through instructions. ,33
Outdated course with unresponsive teaching staff. Screenshots did not match the current IBM cloud and should be updated!,33
Lets not lie... This course was a giant ad for IBM's tools and also a very clever way to gather data about their users.,33
Course Videos were not updated. It took too much time to create account on IBM watson. It was complete waste of time,33
"This course is completely out-dated and confusing. Everyone's complaining, someone really has to look into this.",33
The Watson Studio tutorial is out of date and the product itself is nothing but frustrating.  A bad experience. ,33
The sites are not working and there are no links given. The course could have been mad emuch more better,33
"Videos out of date, which slows down the pace. Unacceptable, considering it's about an IBM platform. ",33
The Interface of the Watson has changed and it takes a lot of time to be able to do the assignments,33
waste of time with no added value. videos are old and don't correspond to the new presented UIs,33
You learn almost nothing in this course. It is sort of an advertisement for what's to come.,33
"The instruction for the final assignment is totally outdated, it was a terrible experience. ",33
"Basically promotion of IBM Watson Studio, Hope rest of the specialization will be better.",33
Out of date very uninformative and full of IBM ads instead of teaching anything practical,33
The videoes were not updated. I have spent hours to figure out how to follow the videos.,33
videos are not helpful at all. you have to find other sources to complete this course.,33
"Totally redundant.. I get the IBM promotion agenda, but it is not useful in this stage ",33
"Update the videos, I do not understand how can you charge for an non updated ourse, ",33
Watson studio connectivity is poor. Lectures are not in-depth and not professional,33
Mi certificado no aparece el nombre de IBM en grande solo se ven rallas azules ,33
The instructions of the videos for completing the graded project are outdated. ,33
Not too much things introduced. Just let you open an account in IBM cloud.,33
Poorly explained. The Git hub part needs to be rethought.  Disappointing. ,33
Instructions to resolve the outdated videos are out of the sequence. ,33
Bit improve it by including some short of practice lab with example.,33
"Very unorganized course , it can be represented in much better way ",33
Difficult to follow as the Jupyter Notebooks have been deprecated.,33
impossible to conclude because of the videos that are not updated ,33
Videos are not updated that's why many learners are complaining.,33
the cognitive labs isn't working the website setup has changed ,33
Outdated Tutorials. Very Difficult to figure everything out. ,33
outdated course in comparison with the IBM data experience. ,33
Where is the instructors ??!!A lot of technical problems.,33
ibm cloud content is outdated to almast irrelevance,33
Update the videos before releasing this as a class,33
Felt like an ad for IBM's data science platform.,33
The links to practice are down since last week.,33
"Waste of time without programming experience,",33
Looks like IBM is just selling their products,33
Too much advertisement for the IBM platform,33
Poor explanations and lack of instruction  ,33
Outdated information needs to be updated.,33
the contents in the video is so outdated. ,33
Videos are outdated compared to programs,33
The video does not fit the instructions,33
It's not that clearly for a beginner.,33
Please update the content and videos. ,33
Not updated Test are very novice ,33
very simple and limited skill,33
Out of date course materials,33
so unnecessary learning path,33

"Course focuses more on forcing you to sign up for various IBM cloud tools than learning python.  The final assignment has a 300+ reply thread in the discussion forum because you are graded on the ability to integrate your IBM Watson Notebook with IBM cloud storage, but the instructions have multiple errors, such as not working if you provision your storage in the wrong region.This class is a shameless excuse for making you sign up for products you don't want, and then grading you on your ability to use them, not your ability to write python code.",47
"Still I don't understand the relation of the course' content and the final assignment. In addition, I would like to see how should have been done the final assignment, i.e an example corrected and done correctly.this is the 4th course and still I can't understand anything of python. I haven't learn anything... my money is going to the waste. IBM says that you don't need previous knowledge of python or programming...that is a lie. I am biochemist and I have a MSc in One health, and during mi years we had lessons of R and R deducer. During that lessons, the materials given by the professors were clear and easy to follow. But this course has been awful..... I am feel like if I were an idiot but I know for sure that  I am not. The problem is this rubbish course. ",47
"The worst course I took. I couldn't believe the course is provided by IBM. The slide is completely unclear and there are some small mistakes in that. And the final project is aimless, I don't know why you come up with such a project for the beginner. Anyway, I'm so disappointed with IBM and this course. ",47
"I had a lot of problems with the Peer Assignment, which had nothing to do with Python Programming. The Watson environment has changed a lot compared to the learning materials.I should not recommend this Specialization, because of the difficulties with the Watson environment. I am willing to help solving the problems.",47
"It is amazing how bad this is considering that it is marketed as an IBM product. This is not the level of quality people expect when they hear the name IBM! You'd be better off paying 9.99 for a Udemy course than taking this course. It is not in depth at all and does a stunningly poor job at building real understanding and competency. The videos and labs are full of sloppiness and errors... again, not living up to the IBM name. I don't know about y'all, but I'm probably never going to pay money for a coursera course again... not really worth it.",47
"The IBM cloud ""service"" leaves much to be desired. Multiple times I've experienced outages while I was in the middle of lab assignments. It's a paid course where they give you ""free"" credits to do the course work in their cloud ""service."" But the credits are inadequate for the labs and they constantly ask for your credit card to buy more ""service."" While the class is okay I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because of the poor IBM cloud support.",47
"The course content is good. However, the instructions for the final peer graded assignment are unclear. It appears to me that we were graded on our ability to interact with IBM cloud and Watson service not so much python skills also. Although I completed, I would not recommend to other until changes are made. It seems I'm not the only one that is unhappy or who had difficulties, just look at the week 5 discussion forum!",47
" (5 stars):  Course was great!!  but,(0 stars):  Instructions for IBM Watson and how to setup the assignments are outdated/incorrect.  It took me less time to finish the course, and a lot more time just to figure out how to setup Watson based on the instructions (website & course material do not match).  This is something that IBM can greatly improve without a lot of effort, imho.The final assignment was an exercise in Watson, and barely on the course material :-(",47
"This class was supposed to be for beginners and most of the information in the videos was easy to digest, however, the final project had elements and questions that were never covered. Also, there were many, many spelling and context errors in the videos and quizzes. This lead to a tremendous amount of confusion and I am not happy with this course or my grade. Please consider reviewing the lessons and final project to cater this course more to beginners.",47
"Time waster, doesn't go in depth, the total video content is of less then 2 hours. The quizzes and assignments are too easy.I recommend Lynda or youtube(derekbanas/thenewboston/CoreySchafer/telusko) or anything but not this course.Really disappointed.",47
The final project at week 5 needs to be completely revamped.  Poor learning experience...absolutely ridiculous and is creating tremendous frustration amongst all students.,47
Final test needs to be actually tested by instructors. Has a few bugs in it. You would learn more about python reading a book. ,47
"Need detailed explanation for the topics, course need to be rephrased accordingly.",47
"No support from moderators, plenty of typos.",47
"the final assignment was extremely poorly set-up. Instructions were full of gaps, omissions, spelling mistakes. Looked like it was written by a deep-expert who assumed a lot of knowledge that you do not have at this entry level and that was nowhere made explicit. I spend many hours on a number of evenings figuring what was meant. If this lead to constructive learning, I'd be OK with it. But now it was just a long egg-hunt to figure out how I was to post something using idiosyncratic IBM infrastructure which taught me little about Python. Was this course even test driven?",47
"The final assignment was not well explained, was hard to follow and the previous material in class was not intuitive to the task.",47
"I would not recommend this course for someone who is completely new to python or programming in general, even though this is a beginner level course. Not only is the course content riddled with typos, but the text following the videos do not match at times making it hard for someone like me (a complete novice to programming) to understand the flow. There are other courses on python and data science out there that one could start with and get familiarised with the terminology first, and then sign up for this one. Working with Jupyter workspace and IBM Cloud was also not very user friendly. There were constant errors on bucket names and endpoints while running the code, which left me confused on what was happening (I believe this was the case with other users in the course as well, as seen from the discussion threads for Week 5). For instance, the tutorial IBM Object Storage does not clearly state which endpoint to use. For my project I ended up using an endpoint that was created in my credentials inside the JSON object. Due to this my code always gave an error. As it turns out, the correct endpoint to be used was listed elsewhere under IBM Cloud, but this was not clearly explained. I had to check with the course instructors to resolve the issue. I must say that the course instructors were very helpful in answering my questions and clarifying all my doubts promptly. I appreciated that. In conclusion, this course is not for someone who does not have any background on programming. Get some basic experience first before coming to this one. ",47
"I am sorry but this is simply terrible.I thought that Data Camp courses could use some work but after this mess - I am gladly returning to them. Save yourself some money and buy a decent book or watch videos on YouTube.My complaints:1) The final assignment doesn't load - I would probably force myself to finish this whole certificate, but I am not able to load the final assignment. Many other people have the same issue. What the hell is this?2) Videos are very low quality - badly edited PowerPoint presentations read by a robot lady voice. No good examples, no engaging elements.3) Quizzes are a joke - I can bet anyone 5$ that you will be able to pass most of them without watching a single video.4) IBM tools overall - you use Jupyter notebooks here through some IBM site. Terribly complicated to set up, loads a while, and notebooks are not very high quality (compared for example with Data Camp). Why not encourage the user to download some Python IDE on their desktop and write the code by themselves?Lesson learned: choose universities, not companies on Coursera. Not taking further courses in this certificate. Spend this money on a book, do some simple projects and put them on a GitHub account - this will be worth 10x more as this joke of a certificate. (First course is worth taking for sure - enjoyable, high quality)",47
"The course is kinda helpful. But please, stop using peer-review assignment. I always get deducted by some stupid or careless guys for NO SINGLE REASON! When you ask some naive students to grade another, they  never give the full marks even there is no flaw in the assignment, just because they are not sure at all about any thing! Tbh, I'm kinda perfectionist. I tried my best to target 100% on every thing then finally got stuck because of others' stupidity. That made me pissed off about the whole thing that I am working on. :(",47
"Course is poorly organised, even the lines of code input by default in the final assignment have issues running, not to mention that the whole project needs IBM cloud/platform support, something students do not agree to before hand.On forums, you may see the amount of problems and difficulties of this ""course"", none from the IBM team replies.Sorry, I will not be recommending this to anyone.",47
"The instructions for the last assignment are absolute garbage and the last project as a whole is mostly a waste of time when it comes to learning Python and data science. Despite errors and use of depreciated functions, the course was otherwise great but the last project's instructions and overall design is awful enough to undo the rest.",47
Horrible. Forced to use IBM Cloud and IBM Watson for assignments. Typos in instructions and not enough information in Week 5 material. Very poorly organized and i would not recommend this course because of how much time I had to spend trouble-shooting IBM Watson/Cloud which I have no intention on using.,47
The course content is very good until you get to the final peer graded assignment which is very unclear what to do and how to tackle and you're left alone to tackle a ton of errors that are mostly irrelevant to what you're learning ,47
Super fast and the examples don't help for the final lab. The final lab is extremely difficult and there is almost no support or guidance to help you with it. Waste of time. I could have paid for a better python course. ,47
Do not waste you money. There is no even a place to ask question if you are not sure. They create a forum which is totally useless as nobody answers your questions when you stuck! ,47
I have wasted a lot of time in learning how to save and upload the data on ibm platform rather than actually learning python. There should be other methods to submit our work.,47
You take more time trying to get to work the IBM products than actually learning python. This is specially salient in the peer-graded assingment,47
Looks like it was made by an intern.  Unclear instructions and terrible video quality.,47
No way someone without Python experience writes the final assignment code unassisted. ,47
"Basically just an interactive advertisement for IBM's new product. Videos aren't very helpful as they show snippets of code without the context in which they would be applied in an actual program. Labs are okay but they use the aforementioned IBM product, and it honestly isn't that great and it isn't something someone using python to do data science would use in a professional setting. The information given about Pandas and Numpy is embarrassingly lacking so the point where doing the final lab is nearly impossible unless you already know what you're doing or you search for information elsewhere. Not why I pay money for Coursera. Wish I could have my money and time back honestly.  ",47
I'm not sure which parts of the lessons are advertisement and which parts are actual exercises that need to be completed.  You are instructed in each segment (so hundreds of times) to not forget to press Shift-Enter for your instructions to be run which is annoying for something so simple.  Then the lesson throws you into the deep end by telling you to get an account of gethub using gist to save your jupyter thing and you end up completely lost after clicking on too many links.  I might have two accounts of gethub or none--I have no idea.,47
"I had been taken several courses with Coursera but this data science specialization lacks good planning and clear directions to complete. I asked many times the same question. I was stuck in the last assignment of week 5 and requested help but the responses were not adequate, I contacted the teacher assistants and even the instructor and just received an email to contact Coursera services. They just ignored me; I'm not sure how many students they have but several others have the same issue with Week 5. ",47
"The third party tool is completely unreliable and it makes this course dissapointing and frustrating. I wasted too much time trying to make it work, since it was either under maintenance or issuing bad gateway errors.From the discussion boards, I saw that I was not the only one getting this type of errors, so it would be nice if a better tool could be used or maybe provide alternate instructions to use those Jupiter pages in Watson.",47
"Lot's of good content. But the labs are very superficial and they just repeat what shown in the videos. The quizzes are too easy and they do not push you to actually apply what you learned. The final assignment was ridiculous. Just using Pandas to import some data, nothing more, no loops, no if statements, no analysis of the data. Continuing being quite dissatisfied with this certificate.",47
"This course was not well designed. It needs intensive editing and rewriting.The author emphasize the use of IBM cloud products, but the course needs to elaborate in this area if this is the desired target.Not enough explanations were dedicated to the Python language itself. To succeed you must know some Python before you learn the course, or learn during the course from other sources.",47
Bad videos.. Many methods and functions in the lab are not explained in the videosTo complete this course I spent most of my time reading documentations and searching to understand what is said as there is no enough explanation or even resources to read from.(Maybe this method suits you but I didn't like it),47
This course is awful.  The information is pretty basic and really doesn't teach you python at all.  At the end of the course they hand you an assignment with coding that is way over your head and when it error's out you don't know how to solve the issue.  ,47
so many issues with Watson STudio and IBM storage. No help from the instructors or Coursera! wasted so much time on finding solutions . Please go to threads and you would get to know every student was facing the same issue,47
"The exercises were few and mainly required copy-paste instead of understanding. Also, the course was full of ads for IBM. Finally, there were spelling mistakes throughout the text, which is just unprofessional.",47
"Don't take it. No Course Instructors, no help. Not worth the money...Even the Working Platform is always timing out or has a gateway error.",47
Week 5 final project SUCKED .. searching forums for 3 days with a URL that works ubtil it gets to 99% and fails. Really poor ,47
"Too fast paced, not very in-depth. Final project is full of spelling mistakes and not coherent with the course. Terrible.",47
"This course is terrible - multiple typos, no support. Final project makes no sense. A total waste of time and money",47
The final project should have had more guidance and instructions in order to complete in a timely manner.,47
The final assignment is impossible to do due to lack of information. Where is the database? ,47
"Not very good, course materials do not match final project deliverables. ",47
lacks rigor and the assignments were way tooo easy....!! thumbs down!!,47
I just paid money to let IBM market their cloud services to me.,47
the last test to pass course nothing is taught about it ,47
Vague assignments- almost everyone gets stuck.,47
The last assignment is very bad explain ,47
Final Assignment is very confusing ,47
"Hi,I completed entire program and received the Professional Certificate. On the Coursera link of my certificate ""3 weeks of study, 2-3 hours/week average per course"" is written. This information is not correct at all, it takes approximately 3 times of that time on average! I informed Coursera about it but no correction was made. It should be corrected with ""it takes approximately 19 hours study per course"" or ""Approx. 10 months to complete Suggested 4 hours/week for the Professional Certificate"".Here is the approximate duration for each course can be found one by one clicking the webpages of the courses in the professional certificate webpage: (*)Course 1: approximately 9 hours to completeCourse 2: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 3: approximately 9 hours to completeCourse 4: approximately 22 hours to completeCourse 5: approximately 14 hours to completeCourse 6: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 7: approximately 16 hours to completeCourse 8: approximately 20 hours to completeCourse 9: approximately 47 hours to completeThis makes in total approximately 169 hours to complete the Professional Certificate.

"Lots of mistakes and imprecisions. In case of technical issues, staff will leave you alone with your problem after one formal and meaningless reply. The staff does not comment more than once on a topic, even if the issue is not resolved.

"I strongly suggest that you look into other providers for learning python for data science. As has been outlined by other reviewers, this is mostly a bad ad for IBM's Watson and there is little actual instruction for actually using Python.  As a background I'm a EE with a lot of hardware coding experience (Verilog as well as Perl).  I completed a specialization in Python from another provider and this gave me quite a bit of help as those classes were clear, with a good progression.  In addition I've now written a bit of Python for work so I have a good base.  This IBM course has, at best, cursory instruction on using Python, Numpy, and Pandas.  The instructions are not clear, with poor sentence structure, and terrible grammar, making it difficult to follow along.  Further, Watson is a confusing mess with instructions that use a prior UI, making it tough to figure out exactly what needs to be done to set up an environment.  Avoid.  Just avoid.  Go to UMich or JHU.  Anywhere but IBM.  The only thing I *did* get from this class is that I don't want to go into Data Science: living in Jupyter notebooks is miserable.  But then, I would also rather build things than write reports.  Your mileage may vary.",47
"I was very unhappy with this course. While the videos are fairly informative and useful, the course assignments are laughably easy. They barely require any thought and absolutely don't practice or reinforce any of the skills you learn - I'm pretty sure you could complete them with no prior knowledge based on the instructions alone. I learn better from doing things, not just hearing about them.Usually, this was earn a 3 star rating from me, but the final assignment is even worse. The 'dashboard' you create is a single graph, and the rest of the final assignment is hosting the jupyter notebook on the IBM Cloud... except whoever set up the course forgot to actually upload the tutorial to do so. You can figure it out yourself, of course, but I didn't need to pay for a course to read documentation and figure out how it works on my own.",47
"This is the first time I am disappointed with a module in IBM Certification course. The module Python for Data Science is very poorly organized. The trainers are rushing like anything just for the sake of completing it. There are lot of confusions after listening to each and every sentences. Another big problem which I noticed is the lack of quality quiz questions. The questions are way easy that a school student can answer without any difficulty. Now comes the biggest drawback; this particular module Python for Data Science  offers  nothing but a display of IBM products. It has less focus on Data Science, though the course name is Python for Data Science. Sorry to give such a low rating for this course. ",47
"The content is great. Instructors are clearly subject matter experts with a passion for the material. But mostly everything else? Extremely disappointing. Confusing questions asked about information irrelevant to long-term success, labs required neither thought nor creativity, and their r typos all clover the pace. I do not say the following lightly. I learned very little from this course, and what little information I did learn is almost certainly on a thousand random blog posts I could read for free. ""IBM on Coursera"" led me to expect an extremely high level of quality, one I long to see met at a later date. Right now, however, that date seems nowhere in sight. Please rise to the occasion. ",47
"I just want to say one thing: there is nothing, nothing of AI in this course.Just some Python snippets for babies. Are you kidding me ?Sorry, but I am very disappointend. This course is related to data science, you can't put the very basics of Python here, it is like going back, and not  ahead.If Python is necessary, please specify it in the ""Prerequisites"", but stop making fun of the people who simply wants to learn and study sofisticated technologies. ** Artificial Intelligence.... You call ""Artificial Intelligence"" making a dataframe from a file csv ?Are you serious ? ** The worst and fake course I've ever took here in Coursera.F.A.K.E. Course.",47
"You learn some basic python coding skills. The pain point is the peer graded project where you have to sign up for an IBM cloud account and Watson Studio account. They are irrelevant to python skills. The instructions (how to set up the connections, buckets, servers, credentials, keys, etc.) are lacking clarity and have sizable gaps. I spent hours struggling with cloud which did not add value in gaining python skills. I would not recommend this course to people who want to learn python. ",47
"lots of errors, can't believe they want to charge for this.  Requires signing up with IBM Watson for several exercises which I refuse to do  (more than a little advertising going on here).  I'm pursuing my programming objectives by downloading Jupyter Notebook tutorials.  These are more convenient and of higher quality.  After completing the Stanford ML course, this particular tutorial came as a real disappointment.  IBM can do better.",47
"I speak for almost everyone who's taken this course in saying that the final assignment was the absolute worst. It's terrible not because the concept was difficult (it's not at all), but because the assignment instructions were so convoluted that it took me at least two hours to complete even just setup. The assignment itself should not take more than 30 minutes. Please update the instructions for the final assignment. Please.",47
"Pros: Good introduction course, thank you!Cons: Typos after typos (from comments one could see many have complained about it, for a long time now). The instruction screenshots for setting up the cloud don't match the actual page, difficult to follow instructions. Occasionally outdated methods/functions, which have been removed from the latest version of Python. It's just not what you expect of a reputable company such as IBM!",47
"While the course material is ok the final assignment is the most frustrating waste of time ever. Specifically question five which has you, a complete novice at python, attempt to upload your assignment to IBM's cloud service using code that is so complex that after 5 hours i simple gave up and submitted hoping hat someone would just pass me out of pity, Avoid this like the plague and go learn on codecademy.  ",47
"Learn experience is very low. There is a lot useful content about python in the course. Unfortunately its basicly watching a video and later repeating it in the laps without relevant transfer.The worst is the final assignment. It is nothing about producing somethin own. Instead you simply repeat given code. The forum is full of people struggling with it, although they do not need to programm on their own..",47
"Course was taught well.There were a couple times that I was extremely lost without direction.If you look at the discussion, for week 5, everyone has the same question, looking for the location of the data for the final. You really have to dig to find it. Like they could have easily posted where the file/data was. I spent more time looking for that document than I spent doing anything else",47
"Full of typos, mis-transcriptions, looks like it was put together by a summer intern who never bothered to proof-read it before leaving to go back to college but IBM slung it up on Coursera anyway.I was never under any illusion that Coursera had any notion of quality control anyway, but I would have expected IBM to have someone skim through it before selling it.",47
"In a peer-graded assignment, the course is teaching new concepts such as the use of bokeh library, boto3 etc. The course isn't even teaching the basics of the same. I have struggled for like 3 days to solve a couple of questions. Moreover, response time from teaching staff/instructor is too high.Course could have been better.",47
"It is exceptionally poorly designed. Most of the time, the labs and the examples in the videos are the same.  The explanations do not provide the logic behind but superficially talk about its function. I would not be able to learn much if I had stuck to this course as the only source of learning. ",47
This is not a course where they tell you the concepts of the Data Science behind or make you learn Python with multiple assignments. It is more of getting userbase to make use of IBM's cloud.Nothing much taught in this course. I could have better utilized my time learning myself.,47
"Horrible! Title looks great on a resume but content is very disappointing. Videos are text-to-speech, peer review for assignment, no instructions for using Watson project, outdated instructions (when your browser accepts to show you the instructions), a nightmare.",47
"The final assignment has totally incomplete information and I wasted a lot of my time figuring out things like data set, dashboard etc which are the details usually well defined in other courses. Really a bad assignment formation. Needs fixing for sure",47
I was not able to complete the Peer-graded Assignment. The Free Cloud Storage service provided by IBM is pathetic as I was not able to add the storage instance to my project. Tried reaching the team but still couldn't resolve the issue.,47
"All the codes are filled in and you don't get ample opportunity to do them yourself. It's too easy to just skim through this class, and requires little thinking. Further, the videos sometimes rely on deprecated functions. ",47
"Need to review the video contents, too quick, weak method of delivering information.I have went through some courses on Python, they are much better than this one.first time bumped into this mediocre course in Coursera. ",47
"i get error :  ""This item will be unlocked when the session begins.This session has not yet started. You may access this item after the session starts on August 26, ""but today 26/08/2019 , i can't access this course.",47
"The course assignment was very very difficult, I think it would be toughest task for non programming background people to complete this course, it should be less difficult so that new peoples can perform it easily.",47
"An extremely basic overview of Python, and a poorly done one at that. Someone with even a bit of Python knowledge will learn nothing at all. For others there are much better alternatives available online for free!",47
The subjects taught were hastily taught at a very rapid pace. Also the assignment steps weren't clearly mentioned and coupled with the Watson Studio problems this course was definitely the worst till now. ,47
"The labs are broken on this course, going by the forum discussion they have not worked for some time.I would encourage IBM or other sponsor of the course to update/fix it ... or Coursera to remove it.",47
I don't recommend this course.They say it is for beginner's but i am telling u if you are a beginner don't use course era .Your time and money is precious.It is as if a machine is reading .The worst.,47
The instructions are outdated and the instructors do not care to reply. I am stuck on the Week 5 project and there is no solid solution provided to solve the issue. A really pathetic experience here.,47
The worse way to teach programming! Week 5 is horrible! I can't believe and don't believe any positive reviews about this course. I cancelled my subscription after this course. ,47
"The course is artificially extended through content locks, so that students who wish to finish it have to pay at least two months worth of a course you can finish in a weekend.",47
typos and the leaps in logic are dramatic.  the lessons versus the final project are significantly different.  i am not satisfied with this course.,47
Poorly written labs and assignments. I ended up spending more time to make sense out of them and set things up than I spent on learning python.,47
Many of the queries went unanswered and IBM Labs were not working half the time.Regret taking this pain for this course.,47
Awful peer assessment at the end with confusing interface that does not work. Do not waste your time and money with is,47

"I am surprised that it was a 4-week course. It could have been condensed to 1 slide stating ""Go read a few books and if you're stuck, consult Stackoverflow"". I cannot believe the average score that this course got and I mean that literally: I can't believe those are real numbers.  There are no course materials, except some crappy unformatted transcripts, the speed is ridiculous and didactically it's a disaster. I now feel sorry for given Andrew Ng's course on Machine Learning only 3 stars, compared to this it should have received 7 stars.  PS I have 30 years of experience in teaching data analysis and statistics, both in industry and at university and I have 35 years of programming experience.",53
"It was the worst experience I had in coursera. The video content is too general and has little connection with assignment. The assignments are challenging but poorly organized. Students are encouraged to search and self-learning, which is irresponsible and inefficient. I register the course to learn things systematically and save time! I spent about 8 hours on searching desperately for each assignment. My passion for Python and Data Science almost disappear.  The version of pandas used in this course is 0.19.2, which is not convenient for using some functions. The assignment is not explained after grading. I had no idea about how well my solution is and whether there is a better way to do it. (The forum may be useful, but it took too much time for searching suitable answers) I have learnt Java before and had little experience in Python. Maybe it's the reason for the longer commitment on those assignments. However, as a former teacher, I do suggest some improvements on the pedagogy in this course and take more responsibility for the students. ",53
"Extremely dissatisfied. Lectures are useless and the instructor didn't put any effort into designing a curriculum. After struggling for days on the second assignment I purchased the recommended text for the class. Week 2 effectively starts at chapter 7 in the book. Instructor needs to replace his absurd amount of face time some slides showing the application and logic behind the methods he is trying to use. Jupiter notebook is a tool designed to make the instructors job easier, doesn't help the student at all. I could go on but this course has drained the energy from me. FYI, half the people that complete (or attempt to to complete) this course don't continue on with the specialization. This should speak volumes. ",53
"This is not a course, rather just guidance to use StackOverflow. The trainer Prof. Brooks is highly unlively and plainly reads out/speaks some statements. He teaches only 10%, remaining 90% you need to explore on your own. The Assignments have the most difficult questions and for solving them, students are not even given any getting-started questions, to begin with! If you wish to learn Data Science/Data Analysis then I would not recommend this course since it is not worth the time, effort and money. Also, the title of the course is devaluing the efforts we put it. The entire course is focused towards using Pandas to perform Data Analysis / Data Cleaning / Data Wrangling / Data Munging / Data Preprocessing and thus I would recommend that the title of the course should be one of these rather than ""Introduction ..."" which hardly gives any weight to what hard work this certification demands!In the brief course videos professor makes some hand gestures and the background shows the people working - both has no relevance and rather prove to be a distraction. Above that auto-grader comes with its own lot of problems which consume hours and days of all the candidates. This course is online for more than 2 years now and I doubt if Coursera really takes such feedback seriously and takes any action for improvement!Request Coursera / UM to go through all the reviews:https://www.class-central.com/course/coursera-introduction-to-data-science-in-python-6671",53
"I have decided to drop this course. I have worked very hard on Assignment #3 for the course and can't seem to get back from the grader anything more than ""Your solution file either prints output to the console (e.g. through the print() function, or it fails to run (e.g. throws an error). You must make sure that the py or ipynb file which you submit does not have errors. The output we received from the ipthon interpretor was:""  That's all I seem to get back.   ",53
I'm not sure you should be paying for a course where you have to search the Internet to learn how to do the assignmens. I could be doing that for free! Is the certificate worth it? ,53
"This is a terrible course. The ""instructors"" give quick little lectures, then we're told, for the somewhat complicated (for a beginner) assignments, to look things up on StackOverflow to figure out how to do the assignments. Um, no. I want a class so I don't have to tear my hair out dealing with the internet.The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization was fantastic. They actually taught how to use R to do data science. I'd hoped for something similar for Python with this class, but I guess The University of Michigan isn't Johns Hopkins.",53
"I found this course terribly bad and was the worst experience I had in Coursera. The instructor, rushes through few minutes of video explanations and then it is basically a learn everything by yourself by reading the panda documentation. If I wanted to learn things by myself reading the panda documentation, I wouldn't have taken the course! Like someone else mentioned, I registered the course to learn things systematically and save time! The assignments require us to do things in panda which where never explained in the lectures, nor it was explained how to do them efficiently. I managed to do everything through hours of research, but I'm pretty sure there are better, more efficient ways to code the assignments but these are not taught, the assignments provide no feedback and the forum too hard and time consuming to search for those answers! So what I learned was that I could either spend hours and hours cleaning the data store in Excel files in panda or few couple of minutes directly within Excel. Because the course is mainly a do everything yourself, it totally failed to show me the power of panda as a powerful tool for data science.",53
"Very rare I write review. And this is rare course that teaches nothing. The lector explains nothing. ""I encourage you self-learning. Read the documentation. Search google. Ask stackoverflow.com. If you don't know python, take another python course. If you don't know statistics, take another statistics course. I encourage you self-learning even more."" - that is what lector sais to you.

",53
"I would not recommend this course at all.  I cancelled after week 2.  It is framed as an intro to data science but the teacher often packs too much information into each video without taking time to properly explain underlying concepts sufficiently.  The exercises often have issues in datasets that are not linked to current lesson which makes it confusing to follow along and you can spend hours searching forums to find solutions.  In addition, the course does not give sufficient insight in videos to help you with questions.  You have to search stack overflow and other sources to work out answers.  Whilst this is reflective of real life, for an intro course which is how this was framed, it is difficult for someone new to data science to master a concept whilst trying to solve for other non related issues searching the web.",53
"I have been doing some coding in different languages and this is my first time in Python. I would say I am on intermediate level (7 years practice), but this course made me spend a lot of time on learning only a tidy bit. The course fails in the basic educational purpose: Provide theoretical lectures and apply it with practical experience. There was little to none connection between these two aspects. The exercises were also way too difficult vs the lectures. I would never recommend this course.My recommendation: Don't make the student spend too much time googling, and solving problem outside of the curriculum, but provide many easy questions as it is a introductory course. Also, Provide a better overlap of exercises vs lectures.",53
"My take -- assignments for week 3 and 4 leave a bad impression. I am quitting halfway through assignment 4. I won't take another class in this sequence. I have taken ~10 online classes this year and only gave up on 2, including this one.I wasted too much time in weeks 3 and 4 cleaning data. When result dataframes have hundreds of rows it isn't trivial to scroll through them looking for problems. Time wasted on this would have been better spent on pandas. I get that data cleaning is a big part of data science, but this is a class not a job.A few questions tended to be vague on requirements but then very particular on what data is acceptable. The worst is getting a question wrong because the answer has type int64 and the grader wanted int. It doesn't help when the grader just says 'wrong answer' and there are no visible tests. The first question on assignment 4 is a good example of that. I did finish convert_housing_data_to_quarters, but from reading discussion forums that too has a few unstated requirements.There were also a few typos in assignments 3 and 4. Again, if you want my answers to be really accurate then invest some time to make sure your questions aren't ambiguous.This could be a valuable class, but you need to invest more in developing the assignments.",53
The class is mostly problem set focused with no feedback on what makes for good pandas code beyond it getting the correct result. Not a good resource for learning the pandas library. Very little teaching. ,53
"I was really excited about the this course, and was really let down. This course is really, really poorly done. I would not waste time and money on this course when there are much better options out there. I feel like I've gotten little in return for my time and money.First, there is no accompanying book (only slides).  A self-contained accompanying book is a valuable resource, helping students prepare for lecture, and serving as a reference manual later on (I still regularly use my Coursera book on introductory Python).  That there is no pdf reference for this class is indefensible (both of the other coursera courses I’ve had access to have had excellent self-contained books that followed the lecture). Instead, the student is directed to several other books they can purchase elsewhere.Second, as several other students have noted, the timeframe for assignments is really unrealistic, taking much longer than projected (at least for me, and several other students).  This is not acceptable when Coursera bills by the month. Coursera needs to provide a better assessment of the time commitments for the class.  Moreover, several of the in-video quizzes are disconnected from the material, often requiring extra research.  Consulting other resources is fine (it’s part of coding), but the point of the quizzes should be to give the student practice implementing a concept that was just introduced.Third, the teaching is horrific. The professor is not engaging at all, but simply mechanically reads lines which often sound straight out of a user manual.  The point of online videos is not to turn books into audio files- it’s to have a human talk/reason through problems with you. The teacher of the course should discuss the material, not recite a manual.  A great example of well-done online teaching is Dr. Chuck Severance, whose videos the teachers of this course would do well to consult.  In addition, the material is presented far too quickly.  Fourth, the title of this course is a misnomer: an introduction to data science would provide an overview of the tools, techniques and scope of the field.  An extremely detailed introduction to Pandas, which is essentially what most of this course is, is useful if well executed (which it is not here), but it is not an introduction to data science. A more minor complaint is the absolutely horrendous choice of the background.  Showing different permutations of lifeless office drones is not exactly inspiring material for aspiring data scientists, even if this the reality of office life- it’s distracting at best, and at worst, deeply disparaging. Why not have just a plain colored background? Or anything else?The experience of this class is making me question whether I will ever pay for a Coursera course again.  The amount of time I’ve wasted on pointless exercises is not warranted by what I’ve learned from this class- in retrospect I would have learned more just by purchasing one of the books referred to in the class introduction. ",53
"I do not recommend this course. If in the end you do take this course don't waste your time with the lectures, 90% of the homework doesn't come from the lectures. In fact the first line in every homework assignment is:
""This assignment requires more individual learning than previous assignment"" This essentially translates into you using google to look up how to do the 90% of the homework they don't cover in the lectures. Also this course should also be changed to be ""Introduction to Data Cleaning in Python"" because you do more data cleaning than anything else in this course. I am sure this review will be buried behind all of the ""top"" reviews even though the most ""helpful"" reviews as voted by people in the course are all 1-stars.
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COURSE. 

 

",53
"Wrost course I have participated in. The assignments aren´t solvable with the provided code. So one had to search and google for all snippets. That would be ok, if the assignment isn´t containing data cleaning every time. So you get an error if you won´t clean correctly and perhaps misses a whitespace. So a simple task gets complicated. And the worse thing is, some answers will displayed as correct but aren´t. So you won´t pass the next questions based on the previous questions. You should know regex quite well and some other tool to be not so much frustrated. Be aware the assignments are way harder then it looks like. ",53
"I cannot recommend anyone to do this course - it's ridiculously poorly constructed.  I have done four other courses on Coursera (including several other python courses) and all were excellent.  The quality of this course though is appalling in comparison.  FIRSTLY They do not TEACH any of the material.  Instead they simply list - very briefly - a ton of functions/ methods/ objects etc without providing any real details of how they operate.  Teaching the basics and then expecting the students to do further study and practice using those basics would be fine.  Spending 30 seconds or less on a function / method/ objects is NOT teaching the basics.   READING A TEXTBOOK on the topics covered was more effective then doing the course material!!!  What kind of modern on-line course is less effective at teaching a topic than a textbook?SECONDLY The autograder for the programming assignments is a joke.  I took the course to learn how to code successfully.  The autograder does not test that - it could not even get question 1 of assignment 3 correct.  Instead, the students are expected to read through the forums and then spend hours making ridiculously stupid adjustments to corrects for errors present in the autograder.  Seriously?  If you are not capable of building a autograder that works, don't have programming assignments that require an autograder.  But realistically, if you are not capable of building an autograder that works, you have no business offering an on-line programming course.REALLY disappointed.  This course should be removed until its quality is significantly improved - it detracts significantly from the Coursera brand name.  If this was the first course I had done on Coursera, I would have thought the platform rubbish and would never have done a second course.  Even now I am concerned about how many other of the courses are this unprofessional.  I've gone from being a huge Coursera admirer and advocate to now not being sure how much I will use (or endorse) the platform going forwards.",53
"Personally I am rating this course at the lowest level possible. Here are my reasons for doing so:The course videos do not teach you much. The video lectures are super condensed and lot of information comes your way and actually trying that out on Jupyter notebook on the side easily takes 5-6 times. When you get down to the assignments, you will realize that videos only scratched the surface of the topic and in some cases some of the concepts to be used were not at all discussed in the videos.You have to learn by yourself, and your best friends are StackOverflow, Google, Python and Pandas documentation. Once you have researched and spent hours putting together the solution to assignments, you will spend more hours struggling with the autograder (At this moment, I am stuck for over two weeks with the autograder at Week3 of the course). If you get the autograder to work then also all you are just going to get pass/ fail result and there is no actual reinforcement that the way you tackled a problem was an efficient way of doing so.I would recommend this course only to someone who can spend 25-40 hours each week just studying for this course. ",53
"This course is not conducive to learning, but rather to getting results. I understand that in the ""real world"" programmers would simply search the web for questions. This is because they need to produce results for their companies. We, as students, need to learn. We are not taking the course to learn what it is like to be a programmer, but rather to understand how the programs work and how to improve our thinking skills. This course taught me how to navigate Stack Overflow and other online resources for Pandas. I was pretty diligent about  trying to understand what I was doing, but it definitely wasn't a requirement for the course. That is my problem: one could sneak by in this course without even understanding a thing. They could simply copy and paste code from the internet , tweak, hit submit  and repeat until they have a 100%. Just a small example, in the last question we do not have to interpret our results in any way whatsoever, just get results. This is not learning.The assignments are good and the TAs are helpful. They should be getting paid. The fact that we need so much help to complete the assignments should raise a red flag.",53
"I found the lectures extremely dry and boring. The entire time I was watching the videos, I was just looking forward to the end. Meanwhile, the exercises were exceedingly difficult. I found myself using apply and groupby methods when they were only introduced in Week 2. Suffice to say, my first few hours on the course can only be describe as 'painful'.I would suggest to anyone reading this to watch Brandon Rhodes' Pycon 2015 lecture. It was way more engaging, and his explanation of concepts were much clearer. The exercises were well paced, and after spending 6 hours or so on both the video and the exercises, my mind has never been clearer on Pandas. I urge anyone who has been recommended this course to drop it IMMEDIATELY. Putting your time into YouTube and Stack Overflow will definitely be more beneficial.",53
"This is simply the worst teaching i have ever seen. the listed requirements are not what is required. instead I ended up googling the possible solutions for 3 hours until i gave up - since there is also no additional material to add. I don't agree with the professors expectations we will just magically know more than he taught in the course. I am paying to be taught at an acceptable level, and this surely was not acceptable.disgraceful. He should not teach anyone anything.",53
"This course was very frustrating.  Sometimes the instructor was clear and other times, very confusing.  The assignments were extremely difficult and included concepts that were never taught in the course.  Suggesting we use Stack Overflow for help instead of simply teaching the concepts in the course was extremely frustrating.  This is not an efficient way for most people to learn Python.",53
"This course lacked written material to accompany the videos and the reference books are presented in a much different flow, so you are left to jump through books and posts to get through anything.  Having the content packaged and delivered in succinct format is what I was looking for and this did not provide that.",53
Absolutely terrible learning support. The professor does not supply helpful information what so ever for the assignments. He expects us to go out of our way to look up information on StackOverflow.com in order to solve the problems. His incompetence in actually demonstrating how this works is abhorrent.,53
"I'm not sure how this course got such high reviews when 90% of the time you'll need to go to Stackoverflow to find out how to do things. The concepts ""taught"" were so basic and barely touched the surface of the required knowledge needed to complete the difficult assignments.",53
Lessons are not helpful if you start from 0 and want to learn. Had to search everything on my own. So what' s the purpose of them? Too little details and assignments too unclear. I came here to learn not to show that I already know.  ,53
"I think most of the people mentioned that in the review. There is a HUGE gap between the lecture and the assignment. I am a beginner level of python and know some programming, and I feel really hard to work with the assignment, most of the content in assignment does not cover in lecture. Basically you need to google almost everything you need to finish every assignment. I have been struggling with that since assignment 2. SO what's the point to take a course, why not I just do the assignment directly and google everything. I hope you can change the content and adjust the conection between material and assignment. If you still want do keep the same assignment, try to give more detail in the lecture or have some examples. At least provide some prerequisite course before further into this course.",53
"This course makes you give up on data science and MOOCs. Seriously, the content is poorly presented he keeps on speaking , telling 2-3 lines about a function and so on.I highly recommend stay away from this pathetic specialization.  ",53
"Very fast pace, no clarity of the scope and poor leacturing",53
"I would not recommend this course at all. This is for a number of reasons.The lectures are not really lectures, they are more of a narration of someone else writing code on screen, the intructor just whizzes through what's happening without giving any proper explanation (I cannot stress this enough). The limited explanation provided is just on what's happening on the screen rather than why we're doing it this way compared to any other way. There is also not enough guidance given in the lectures but told to just figure it out and go post on Stack Overflow. Anyone familiar with Stack Overflow should know, they *really* do not like beginners posting repetitive questions - so I find that advice from the instructor really odd.The courses makes use of Numpy, but gives zero explanation on what Numpy is and why we use it. It just dives into it by using Numpy arrays and expects you to either magically understand it or go learn what/why Numpy, from someone else.Speaking about assignments, a lot of the excercises require you to do something which hasn't been covered in the sessions at all. I understand giving a challene in assignments, but I would much rather prefer those challenges be related to things taught or from resources given / pointed to. But, unfortunately, you have to figure a lot out on your own and the videos are of no help.It also doesn't help that the assignment feedback is very lacking. The grader also does not tell you what answer it expects, so you have no way of knowing how far off your answer is.This is further not helped by the out-dated version of Pandas running (0.19.2). It has a 4 year old version. I tried to do the assignments locally, but then coming onto Coursera to find the methods I've used aren't supported. This causes further frustation with the ""go learn on your own"" approach, as every resource you'll find will be using methods/functions from the latest versions. You then have to spend hours more finding legacy methods for what you're trying to do (which, in practice, will be useless as you will always be working on updated packages)In my opinion, this course is not worth the money. I would highly recommend you trial its contents before deciding whether to pay for it or not.",53
"Wish I could give it zero star.1- The lectures are extremely poor (read the most helpful reviews and you see that a lot of people share this opinion).2- Assignments are super difficult and not related to the lectures.3- Assuming that you manage to solve the questions, now you have to deal with their defective auto grader which is royal pain.4- They insist on using Jupyter (in my opinion a really messy environment). I used PyCharm which is the default IDE for python nowadays but their auto grader caused me so much headache.Overall, this course requires significant changes and more respect towards the students who spend a lot of time on it. For me personally, it killed my motivation for pursuing Data Science and taking more courses from this instructor.",53
"This course is very difficult. This is first of all not a introductory course. The instructor teaches basic stuff but the assignments were look like mountain. It is quite impossible for a beginner to solve this type of assignment problems without having a very good background in python programming and data structure handling. I should recommend, the instructor should revise the course content. Please bring balance between what you are teaching and what you are expecting from student. After taking this course, I personally demotivated from taking further courses in this specialization. *********** I will recommend going for IBM data science specialization.********",53
"Would give this class a half star if I could.  The material is covered way too fast and the assignments require knowledge of items not even mentioned in the class (let alone discussed).  If you know the material well enough to get through this class, you don't need the class.  The prof and TA refer to using Stack Overflow to figure it out early and often!  Found this class to be a waste of time and money.  I wanted to learn the material, but had to drop the class because I had no clue how to do the assignment after watching the lectures multiple times. ",53
"I have no idea who rated this class five stars. The lectures do not prepare you for the assignments and the auto-grader will grade your answer as incorrect if you return a 17 dtype='float64' and they were expecting a 17 dtype='float'. Also, there's absolutely no feedback on your work except from the auto-grader, so there's no opportunity to go back and see a more elegant way of writing your code. I managed to get 90%+ for every assignment, but it was only because I spent over 10+ on the homework assignments for the last two weeks. ",53
"The jupyter notebook made this a horrid experience.  Plus Coursera really doesn't want you to bother them with your silly questions, relying on peer-forums.  If you scroll through the week's discussion forums, many student posts go ignored.You can't drop the course past the second (I guess) week so the system will keep on keeping on long after you've given up on trying to figure out the janky notebook thing.Will not return to Coursera for any reason.  Breathtakingly bad experience.",53
"This is definitely not an  introductory course. This is more of an intermediate level course.  The teachers explain complex techniques in one or two sentences. The notebook demonstration in the video lectures are also very fast. There is a huge gap between the contents in the lectures and the assignment questions. These points should be kept in mind while choosing this course. I think, I will not take other courses in this specialization. ",53
"This course is poorly organized, the instructor doesn't clear the most important basic concepts and pitfalls, instead just gives a brief through what can be done. The assignments are terrible, cannot state the problem clearly, didn't say anything about text files issues which causes submission problems, waist a lot of time on it. ",53
This was the WORST course I have ever taken on Coursera.  The final exercise questions were not specific enough and the autograder SUCKED ASS. I couldn't even refer to a column in my dataframe after I closed the browser 3x and rebooted my machine and it still did not work. This course is a WASTE OF TIME. MOVE ON!!!,53
"Very disappointed! The assignments are unclear. To complete the assignments, you need to google on each question especially in Week 2 and 3. If you go to ""Forum"" page, you could see that there are more than 1400 threads in Week 2,3, which means a lot of students ask questions. The course is really really bad!",53
One of the worst course I ever take in coursera. The instructor just writes codes on front of us without explanation. ,53
terrible course please improve teaching efficiency and give a proper realistic assignments ,53
The autograder wars made this a bad experience,53
Introduction to searching Stackoverflow,53
"This is in fact the worst course so far. Mainly because of auto grader. Here are my reasons.Actually I did not complete the course at all. But I suddenly got a message saying that I have completed the course. I was working on the first problem of the 4th assignment. I did a provisional submission to see if my answer was right. Auto grader reported the grade for the 3rd assignment and said that I have passed the course. Any submission I did after that  was not graded at all.The assignments are not very clear. Looks like I had a older version of the questions while others had a different version. I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints. When we are stuck in a problem, we are not able to proceed further. I still son't know the answers for certain problems because the coordinators do not explain the answers well. When we complete assignments we don't get to see the instructor's solution.   The video instructions were too fast paced. The instructors do not pause and explain critical aspects of the code.  Overall I am very disappointed with this course.  There are much better videos on Youtube and Lynda than this . I am sorry. I never thought it would be this bad. The first course on Python from University of Michigan was really very good.",53
"Not sure whether this course is trying to reach data science or Python, but it does a poor job at both.The class is a light-speed tour through NumPy and Pandas, definitely not for the neophyte Python developer (which I am not). There's 30-40 mins of lecture each week that's basically lightly narrated typing into a Jupyter notebook with only the slightest bit of additional explanation about what the instructor is doing, although the material covered is substantial. There's lot of important details that are glossed over -- forcing the student to pause the lecture and do offline research to understand what just happened.Similarly, the assignments address and cover beyond the material covered, but the instruction is scarcely sufficient to understand the concepts required to complete them, so lots of Stack Overview and other research is required. And the automated grader, as expected, is completely literal so for complex problems, not much help in validating whether you're on the right track. Assignments take many multiples of the estimated time.And because even for paying students (such as myself), you never get access to an answer key even after the assignment is due, you have no idea how closely your solution conformed to best practices, even if you arrived at the right answer. For coding, this makes all of the difference, particularly with large datasets that could consume considerable computing resources if not done correctly. I'm told this is because of potential cheating by learners.How would I change this course? Simple: 3x more lecture material to actually explain what's going on, or down-scope the class so that the existing lecture time becomes adequate for the material.",53
"Very poor course, badly taught and terrible value for money.  The lessons are brief beyond any form of reasonableness, the teacher seems completely unconnected with his students.  There is no detail at all and no logical progression.  I took and passed this course with a view to doing the specialisation but I'm not going to waste any more money on University of Michigan courses.  I've found similar courses on other platforms which cover the same material.  The assignments were awful, in some cases they covered material to be presented the following week, in others the questions were wrongly stated and did not match the output from the machine grading.  The machine grading itself gave you no clue as to where you went wrong.  I'm not talking about the odd question here or there, I'm talking about consistently throughout every assignment.  I don't normally, in fact ever, leave bad reviews, I usually just chalk it up to experience and move on but in this case, the course was so bad, I had to say something.  I've done two other courses on Coursera with Rice University and the difference to this course is huge, while I would wholeheartedly recommend the Rice Intro to Python courses, Don't do this course, it is not coherently presented or graded.  The mentors in the forum tried their best but even they had to admit the grading system was riddled with errors.  Absolute rubbish, avoid and spend your money elsewhere.",53
"I have just completed this course. I have learned quite a bit about the pandas library and that has nothing to do with this course. The lectures seemed to be scripted; and extremely condensed. At best, they can be used as a sparse reference manual for some undefined subset of the pandas library. The assignment 4 instructions encourage googling things. Basically ""go forth and figure it out on your own"" ... why would I need a full course for that piece of advice? The autograder seems to forbid the usage of certain lines of code in  Assignment 4. It will reject your answer and give you no feedback whatsoever with respect to the reasons why your answer was rejected.As well, it has inconsistencies that will cost you time. The question on the recession_start() function will be graded as correct if recession_start() outputs a certain value, say x. Yet, in another question recession_start() is expected to output some other value y. Go figure. Not even a warning about it.So, to sum up the salient points:1. Autograder has holes.2.Extremely condensed scripted lectures and sparsely sprinkled with practical advice.3. Useful for letting you know that pandas exist. Disappointing.",53
"This course is poorly done, and I'm sorry but in no way close to an intermediate level. Even knowing a fair amount of python, I struggled with learning from this course. I find it ironic that the teacher specializes in education and mostly sits in a chair and speaks code at you. There are very few visual aids to help. Furthermore, individual topics are not broken down well, showing you how to develop a mastery over the fundamental data objects like a data frame before moving on to the next. Code that is demonstrated is typed out unreasonably fast, and very few examples are done on how to properly access the elements in different ways. The video where the grad student/post doc spits out code 3 lines a minutes made me laugh at how ridiculous it was as if it were an explanation. I ended up very frustrated with this course, and I'm not convinced it's all me or my inability to learn. I suggest learning data science in python from another site, I'm already finding a different class much better and more understandable. Your mileage will obviously vary.",53
"A very solemn warning for those working professionals who wish to add this valuable skill or change career, which is so in my case, DON'T spend time on this course! The problem comes from a very error-prone auto-grader system and an outdated pandas library used by this course. I understand the ability to research your solution in the absence of guidance is a valuable skill, which is what the course instructors claim. However, setting the student up with an outdated library where the student not only has to figure out how to search for their solution but navigate different library versions is just mean and irresponsible.If you are planning to be a programmer, I do see the value of grinding this skill out of you. But if you are a domain expert that wants to learn ""Applied Data Science"" which is what this course is supposed to be for. I do not see the value of dropping the student in the deep end and having them figure out version updates and learn outdated syntax.Our time is valuable, go learn from people who respect your time. I will.",53
"Total disaster. I payed 315euro for this course. Course started on 24/10/2016. I faced with technical difficulties till this weekend. I reported this problem already many times.. Finally this weekend the Jupiter notebook worked and I started the first assignment. I spent many hours but still couldn't get solve the assignment. I read discussions, write post.. Searched on Google.. Read lots of document. I still couldn't get what the correct answer is the assignment wants. I realized that it is impossible to pass this exam. In the lectures they don't mention anything which will help you to solve this time consuming assignment by the way.. After having this terrible course experience this weekend, today (14/11/2016) I decided to apply for refund. But guess what I says 14 days have passed so I cannot get refund!!!!  Now I payyed 315 euro for nothing but disappointment!!!!",53
"Anything but 'Pandorable'. My first programming class was 'Python for Everybody' by Dr. Chuck. It was perfect for a novice like me. Chuck was tough, but fair. I then moved on to this class. 'Intro to Data Science in Python' is the complete opposite of everything you'd want in a so called 'intro' class. Brooksy is impossible - no Dr. Chuck. He plows through course material like he's got somewhere to be causing you to re-watch each of his lectures multiple times. Proceeding to the assignments you immediately realize they aren't related in the slightest to the lectures you just consumed. This forces you to consult google, github, stackoverflow, your peers, and anyone else with an extensive programming background. That's all fine and dandy for, say, an advanced or intermediate class, but keep in mind, this is supposed to be an INTRO class...Good luck...",53
"besides the major technical issues and lack of information before the postponed start of the course and minor technical issues, the way of teaching is well adapted to on-site classes where you can sit in study groups solving the problems together; the given examples have partly little relevance and do not help to solve the assignments and according to the staff the best way to solve assignments is by using google (or stackoverflow or whatever) - really?! somehow it seems they just took an on-site course, played with some fancy technical solutions and call it now a MOOC... they seem not really aware of the fact that on-site teaching and MOOCs require completely different types of pedagogic methodsamazing how the same university can offer both the best MOOC (Dr. Chuck's) and one of the worst (this one) ",53
1)Auto grading for assignments worked on and off (mostly off). I spent far more time for the auto grading than the time I spent for actually doing the assignments and learning stuff. I considered quitting after the first week and had to really force myself to go on. 2) This course requires Python experience. This should be made more clear in the course description. I struggled a lot because I lacked Python experience.3) The instructors have pacing issues - especially the teaching assistant. They rush the important points.4) I think the difficulty level of the quizes and assignments is not encouraging learning. I considered quitting after the first week. I'd have easier and more motivating earlier quizes/assignments; then build up on them.,53
"Lectures are useless. The assignments are good but the skill level of the material covered in lecture is like learning to crawl, and then you are supposed to be able to jump and dance when it gets to the assignment. Suggestions to bridge the gap are to look at Stack Overflow and various free tutorial sites, but that reduces the class to a packet of problem sets that I could get online for free. Not wasting any more time on this course. Severely disappointed in Coursera. I thought I could trust the content here but apparently they are satisfied releasing stuff that doesn't help at all. ",53
"Worse course ever. Materials don't provide enough information for performing assignments. Explanation is very short, general and isn't clear. Actually the course doesn't explain almost anything in Pandas structure, functions and approaches. As a software engineer I'm capable of solving complex problems. But here it's not about solving problems, it's about self studying and surfing Internet obtaining knowledge. What the course for?  Wrong column names, mistakes in formulas... Why the quality is so low?I'm really disappointed spending time for it. Have to cancel it on the second week.",53
"The content of the course is adequate to python users with a beginner-intermediate level, but lectures are fast-paced and do not seem to be focused on the student. Instructors just comment functions and methods characteristics as if they were reading it from Pandas documentation. Before this course I did not have any Python knowledge apart from the specialization programme Python for Everybody from the University of Michigan, which was much more oriented to beginner students. I recommend some more experience to take this course.",53
Lecturer just regurgitates code out loud (completely worthless). You can't get answers back without paying for the course (fine but it would have been nice to mention that up front in the audit) so you get little feedback as you might want it.Many of the questions/code is impossible using only the python described in the course. I wanted to take this as a python refresher and it was a complete waste of time. The subject matter is perfect! But execution is abysmal.,53
"The background for the lectures was really distracting. You shouldn't have people in the background ever. The lectures didn't provide the information needed to solve the assignments and the answers aren't given after the assignment is due. So the course doesn't really teach much by itself. You need to do a lot of extra googling on top of the lectures. In that case, you may as well do your own projects for free rather than $40/mo for inadequate lectures.",53
Serious issues with the assignment grading system will result in you pulling out your hair due to only getting credit for erroneous assignment grading system instead of learning.Literally have to read the discussion forums to figure out how to replicate the errors the grading system is looking for. Huge waste of your time.Wait atleast a year from this review to consider taking the course and pray they have finally edited it by then.,53
No or least support.Course Quality is great but problems with grader will left you with wasting your expensive time.Assignments are good but intend to go wayyy more beyond the scope and to learn from online materials though other sites.Grading system is not easy. You have the right answer but you'll need to waist hours to produce specific string for your grader to be satisfied.This i not an elegant learning process at all.,53
"Horrible course. The instructor is reading the course from a prompter. '95% of the time, you see the instructor reading from the prompter, and two people working in the background. When they actually show the code the instructor is talking about, it goes so fast that it's impossible to read the screen. The instructor provides no motivation or background to what he says. He just rattles off the words in a uni",53
"Instructor gives minimal examples and says ""go look on stack overflow"".  Then he proceeds to assign problems that don't really cover what the slides, lectures, or examples were on. If I all I was trying to do was just read some docs and look on stack overflow I wouldn't need to take this course now would I?Poorly translated and cryptic instructions for assembling furniture are better than what you get here.",53
"The assignment is much more harder than what I learnt through these videos. I know the professor want us to learn more by searching on Google, but it really took me a lot of time to find the answer for every assignment! I attend this course only because I want to learn Python easier than self-learning, but this course make it become much harder for me and I even think of not futher my study in this area.",53
"You will spend more time fighting the autograder than actually learning. You will learn more from youtube videos than this course. The only reason to do this course is for the certificate, even then, watch a youtube video or two before starting this course so that you can grasp the material. Also, before doing an assessment, watch the next weeks videos as the videos are a week lagged to the assignments.",53
I am an engineer and I use matlab and stata for data analysis and currently taking Machine Learning course by Stanford which is fabulous. I did not like this course for the following reasons: 1- bad course design structure 2- so confusing and inappropriate sequence3- super fast without providing any intuition 4- no fundamental explanation 5- course could be longer and spend enough time in each subject ,53
"This course is no good.Unable to run the assignments at my comfort. Half the time there is some issue in submitting the code in  jupyter and with hard pressed timelines at work this does not take me anywhere. As a data scientist with little programming background, it is difficult to enable our journey with this course.Sorry to say. This is a big disappointment for me.",53
"This is not a course. The videos and resources provided do not provide sufficient insight to properly learning Data Science or even getting through the assignments. Content and assignments have rarely anything in common. I would have to spend more than 12 hours to solve one of the assignments. Do not recommend, you are better off leaning out of google.  ",53
"The descriptions of assignments (especially 4) are not very clear. It wastes our time searching what's wrong (you can see the same question is raised up through the years in discussion forum), which always is just because the formatting issue that is not explicitly stated or different interpretations. The assignments should be extensively updated.",53
"Not really an introduction course. The lectures are moving very fast, without really explaining the material. The assignments are much more complicated than the material learned during the lecture. Almost not related at all. I had to learn everything from google. Not for beginners!!! This course will take all your free time and will to live... ",53
"Waste of time. If you know python, you'll probably learn nothing new here. If you don't, the professor goes into WAY too high a level, and quickly, for you to actually learn anything. Moreover, he barely touches on why any of this is important, does not go over scikitlearn or numpy, both very important in data science / machine learning.",53
"The courses/videos do not cover most of the topics which are needed for assignments. Have to Google or read lot materials in order to pass. Furthermore the videos are extremely boring as well. This course is not main for the learners who just started to learn Python, as this will demotivated the passion of a person to learn Python.",53
1. Very difficult to follow and I had to redo this course multiple times to understand the concepts.2. Feels like the tutor is just reading off a screen and not explaining a topic from his standpoint.3. The assignments and course topics are disjointed at times.4. Examples provided are rather complex and needs to be simplified.,53
"Un curso poco práctico, los vídeos son demasiado largos, dando vueltas sobre los mismos conceptos básicos y los ejercicios son bastante complicados en relación al temario (se espera que se busque por internet en páginas como Stack Overflow). No se trata nada de algoritmos, es casi todo limpieza de datos y cambios de formatos.",53
"The pace is too fast! I can not keep up with the course content :(I had studied ""Python for everybody"" specialization and ""Python3 programming"" specialization before. I thought I am now ready for this course but ....I am going to study some introductory books or find other tutorials first and then come back to this course.",53
"A large disconnect between material and assignments. Video lectures not very good and much to short. Assignments had a lot of very annoying data cleaning etc as opposed to better understanding of data frames and pandas, while this is indubitably important in real data analysis it seemed a bit early to  bring it in.",53
"Teaching material is poorly organized, and more of information covered in the assignment are not covered in the teaching material. It truly ""self study"" course. Just skip the video and dive into google. Even assignment question need lot clarification as well. Auto grading is a nightmare.",53
waste . your videos were useless cause you havent thought much . all the assignmnets were out of portions then what is the point of me seeing your videos if your assignments are all out of portions . worst course ever the only good thing is that the assignments were challenging ,53
"The instructor sucks. He writes codes in the video and does nor explain the logic behind it. i can find the code everywhere, what I need it to learn why we do it? Most of the time you find find yourself staring at the instructor's face, not codes and explanations",53
Terrible course. Assignments are extremely buggy and often touches on things not even explained in the lectures. Mentors are not active. Explanations are sketchy and not well paced. Do this course only for the examples in the Jupyter notebook.,53
"This course was very dissapointing, the instructor only explains what is going on in the code and does not provide any explanation on how to structure lines of code. Professor Charles Severance is more engaging in teaching coding languages.",53
"Lectures are brief, shallow and too compressed
Grader is buggy
Generally course is bad. I spent more time in Stackoverflow than here to find answers
I can read books and surf pandas docs by my own, what is the sence.
Just a waste of time",53
"As atividades do curso são bem confusas, devem melhorar muito ainda. Não adianta dificultar para ter que passar várias horas no fórum para entender a pergunta e ver dicas. Enquanto não consertarem os exercícios não recomendo.",53
Worst Course ever.The assignments are way tougher than taught in the lecture.Complete and utter waste of money.Please improve the contents of the course and provide detailed list of various functions.,53
"this course is horrible. The lecturer go through things so fast without emphasis, let alone highlighting the rationale behind of each things. Totally confused, worst class I have ever took in Coursera",53
"Awful. The examples are boring, pace is slow, and instruction is little more than ""go to StackExchange."" Most course 'discussion' involves the clunky, bug-riddled auto-grader. Don't waste your time.",53
"Hard to follow this professor. He reads off the script and reads really fast. I have a background in Porgramming but this is the most confusing programming class I have ever attended, sorry :(. ",53
"The examples are a bit too extreme head on, I have experience with python but the level at which this is provided is quite hard for anyone to jump in and it should not be advertised as such",53
"This course is for knowing what you can do with python in Data science, definitely is not a course to learn python or for people like me who only had basic knowledge of python.",53
My opinion of this course has already been stated here: https://medium.com/@masseybr/university-of-michigan-introduction-to-data-science-in-python-course-review-50eb37f5ff0d,53
"Course doesn't give you any tools to use, it only expects you to solve problems with the tools you find from internet. Buy a book, at least it is better.",53
"instructor is too fast, video lectures are not enough and assignment questions are not clear which wastes much time just to understand the question",53
Videos only cover a fraction of the material needed to solve the assignments. Better off buying a book that explains the concepts in more details.,53
You're honestly better off getting a free tutorial online somewhere. I would only pay for this course if you absolutely need the certificate.,53
"Course was full of bugs, learning material was much easier and simpler to understand than the tasks and assigments that were given later on.",53
The pandas software is out of date which caused me much stress and frustration in submitting assignments. PLEASE UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE.,53
Videos doesn't help or prepare student very well for assignment. I had to study and found material all by myself. Unuseful,53
"Among more than 20 MOOC followed, I guess this is the worst one. I won't repeat here the arguments of other learners.",53
"Bad tutorial video, scattered teaching content, not corresponding homework, lack of material to review the  lecture ",53
"course too fast, they don't explain anything, just run through example. The worst course I have taken on coursera. ",53
Unorganized and not very useful. The main goal of the course is for you to use Stack Overflow.....SAVE YOURSELF $,53
This course is a joke. Contents is very very poor. And you will have a lot of problems making the Assigments.,53
The instructor was pathetic. He is simply reading the text and not putting in any efforts to explain things. ,53
"The lectures are insufficient, the homework instructions are incorrect, the autograder is terrible.",53
pathetic course. Not for anyone who wants to learn python. Its for them who already know python,53
Instructor is not interested in teaching but just reading out the script,53
"This course is not suited for beginners, who wanted to learn python. ",53
Horrible. Explains nothingJohns Hopkins data science is FAR superior,53
Poorly organised. No helpful resource. Really sad course. ,53
"Vedio is useless, I only need to go through the code.",53
the teaching pace is very fast and not so clear.,53
Gap between lecture and assignment is too high.,53
"Disconnected, too broad, could have been great.",53
Worst class ever! The instructor sucks!,53
Not exactly benefited.Too fast,53
autograding system is terrible,53
assigments are not clear,53
The speed is too fast,53
not good course,53
outdated,53
"This course was a travesty. 1. The version of Pandas being taught is not the current version.... so good luck applying this anywhere OR searching for help. 2. The lecture material was wiffle bat level then the assignments were mack truck level 3. I am a professional developer, I know how to use stack overflow and pandas documentation to solve problems. I was looking for a fundamental grounding of the materials. 4. I do feel I came away with a basic understanding of using pandas and python, but that's because I spent about 100 hours looking up answers to every question on here. 5. The lecture is so superficial that you'd learn a python way to do something, then a pandas way to do the same thing, then another pandas way to do something, then that would be the starting block for the assignment that would use advanced concepts. As a result I know 9 ways to do something simple with no recommended best pattern or understanding of when to use one or the other--and they all kind of muddle together now, but then spent dozens of hours researching the actual answers to the questions. ""This is the way I like to do xyz, because of this. There are 3 other ways you may see and I'll briefly show you them"" would be great. 6. For how important it is, the distinction between methods that mutate data and methods that don't was pretty minimal. 7. The online exercise thing is worthless. It uses an old version of pandas AND there are certain code breaking idiosyncracies in the tool AND it considers a pandas INT wrong if it's looking for an INT but there's no requirement in the question and no discussion of how to transform these or if there's any reason to do so other than to make the autograder happy. Look in the forum, there's straight answers like ""an upgrade broke this, so it is not expected to work"" which is a bad experience if you spend a few hours trying to debug code before looking up the answer. IT shakes your faith in all the exercieses. 8. This may be a coursera thing, but I'm learning this for WORK, I need to be able to get stuff working on my local PC. I see the autograder makes things easier, but it's basically a similar but different API. I literally spent 1 hour converting my code so the online grader would run for every 2.5 hours of local coding I did. It's debilitating. 9. This is probably a coursera problem, but it's really difficult to find the question you asked in the forum. Since you can't get through most of this course without forum assistance, that hurts. 10. I feel like I got gas lighted. You cannot do this class without already knowing python. This is mentioned in one of the lectures after you've already signed up. He recommends the Python for Everybody course, but it is very unclear from the Course Description before you pay money. Here are quotes from it, tell me if you would expect this to teach you python: *""This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment"", *""including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas"", *""SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN: Python Programming"". Then the forum is peppered with answers that say ""This is not a python programming class"". So... SUMMARY: This was my first coursera experience, I was very much looking forward to it and it really shook my confidence in the site. I did learn how to work pandas, but would have done just as well with a list of problems and a google. The ""16 hours to complete"" took me over 2 weeks of full time work--roughly 100 hours--due to both this disconnect between the lecture and the assignments and to the difficulties transforming working local code in a modern version to a buggy online grading system working on an old version of python but with some patches that also render legacy forums only 80% useful as well. The lectures manage to be both superficial and confusing (because they take a superficial topic then jam 4 ways to do the same thing into 30 minutes). And despite the course description you do not learn an intro to python here, just to data science. I will be trying one more coursera course, basically because all the other reviews on here say this is an abnormally poorly run one, but if they're all like this I will return to pluralsight soon.",53
"The course is a great course in terms of the knowledge and experience of the instructor and the helpfulness of the staff. I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning. I just wish it were better structured and supported and that I learned more about the work rather than just searching online for how to write something.",53
"Well, first thing I am going to say this is not going to be looking good, however correct me if I got anything wrong or being unfair.To be honest, I am very frustrated with this course! It is a very good topic that I am very interested and that's the reason I am enrolled , but the support and the structure of it is very disappointing!Example like this(https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/discussions/weeks/3/threads/0kwIpLJDEeawPhIF4bjuNg), question is not even specified and waste me so much time looking for the requirement and post discussion board and wait hopefully somebody is going to reply!Same for the ScimEn file , which again the file name was not specified in the question!From last secession, assignment two have lots of confusing around what exactly the question is asking about and again lots of time being wasted just to figure out the question!The support is poor as well, not like other course , I would usually get a answer within the same day , but this one is really when you are lucky! Plus the staff rarely response!In short, I hope the staff of the course would see this. This is a good topic but the course are poorly designed with very limited support!I mean if you are truly love the topic , you should pass on the passion to your students and design the course that students not only learn the material in the course but also can know how to ask questions and find out the questions themselves ,but first like learning any skills students needs to ask lots of questions ! I am not going to mention that ,coz even the question in the course is full of error !!Unless, the whole purpose is to make some money , then it make sense , however if it is that case , I am not going to enrol in this course any more.",53
"After having done quite a few other courses from UMICH (mostly taught by prof. Charles), I had high expectations from this one. I must sadly say I am extremely dissapointed.1) The course itself doesn't teach anything. The videos basically say: ""Here's pandas. It has functions. Good luck"". If you want to learn what to do, you are encouraged and have to search it online, because such materials are not provided in the course. In my opinion it cannot be called a course, if all it does it says ""Hey, there exists this thing called Python and Pandas. If you want to learn about it, go do it somewhere else. You're welcome! ""A responsible course would provided well strucured materials for students to study. Videos showing a proff. reading off slides are not particularly useful.2) Assignments are messy and it seems not much thought has been put into them. Whilst I do like the challenge itself, spending 3 hours figuring out why the autograder gave me no points is completely useless and frustrating: you get no feedback, no hints, no nothing. Eventually you may be able to find some hints on the forum, but seriously....those 3 hours could be way better spent on some actual materials, rather then trying to figure out a formatting issue.I could go into more detail, but you get the idea. I was really excited about this specialization, but I will not continue with it. Again - I've nothing against a challenge - so a more difficult curricula - but I cannot work with a completely lack of curricula and structure , as well as materials.",53
"This is not my first time with the University of Michigan, I have completed both the ""Python for everybody"" and ""Python 3 programming"" specialisations; and i must say , this is an assignment course, the material is rushed (if you are just talking about 10 pandas methods in an 8 minutes video,; you need to review your pedagogy). Paul resnick , dr.chuck and steve oney are really good teachers, they go into the details.But i don't know if he was forced to , but Christopher brooks doesn't  seem to bother with explanations (you should learn everything on stackoverflow; well guess what ...i came to coursera for the material not the assignments).He had already done that in the 5th course of the python3 programming specialisation(sometimes explaining code without showing it),it took me 5 days to complete that assignment(notebooks crashing for no reason i ended up using my own but i guess this has to do with the platform ) .some more pedagogy and slower ,deeper explanations are required for this course.Not worth the time nor the attention.Just learn on Youtube and Stackoverflow or some other ressources(like the many books provided in this course) then once you are ready, pass all the assignments(which are great ,if the material needed was covered this course would be perfect)",53
"This class is an absolutely horrible experience for those of us new to programming and data science. For a few of the assignments, you are asked to return a dataset based on the merging of multiple data sets. A better approach would have been to have a checkpoint at each step to ensure the resulting data frame met the requirements.  For example, if the data set needed to be ordered in a certain way with the header formatted a certain way, then let's have a separate checkpoint for the order of the values and yet a different checkpoint for the header values.   The staff needs to understand that having the correct answer at each step of the process is not a bad way to help the student know if his/her code is correct.  After all, the staff can easily modify the dataset read in by the student's code after submission to ensure that the student did not use any hardcoded values.Despite the frustration with the Coursera platform, I can honestly say this is the most fun subject I've had in a long time. But the format selected is absolutely horrific and not conducive to learning and understanding the material.  ",53
"The main focus of the course is the introduction of the Pandas (series and data frames) library, which is very useful in data analysis. The last two assignments are quite challenging and time consuming, if you are not familiar with Pandas. Why the poor review: I'm sure that the intention of the teacher (Prof. Brooks) is for the student to be challenged and obtain familiarity with several ""advanced"" functionalities of Python. When I had finished the last assignment I felt that way, but not due to the lectures (only ~2.5 hours all in all). The pace of these lectures is too fast (probably because they are scripted). The teacher should slow down a bit and show some more examples (for inspiration watch Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford lecture on machine learning). I'm not suggesting to show explicit solutions of the assignments, but just a few more examples such that the transition from lecture to problem solving is less ""frustrating"". Furthermore, the students are paying $79 for this course expecting thorough lectures on the topic. Reading the documentation of the Pandas library can be done for free...",53
"Read the reviews carefully before signing up for this course.I would not recommend this course to anyone. It is branded as an Intro course, but it is anything but an intro course. The instructor whips right through the material without much explanation as to the how and why of what he is doing. Then when it came to the assignments, the assignments were way harder to the material covered, and I spent hours pulling my hair doing research on StackOverflow and GitHub just to figure out how to get the data sets to work correctly so the auto-grader could pass my problem. I ended up dropping at the fourth week because I knew I couldn't finish the project without referencing other people's work on GitHub and there was very little instruction on how to set up and do the final project effectively.There have been very few courses in my life that I felt utterly defeated by, and this is unfortunately has been one of them. I am going to pursue other data science courses on Coursera and other resources that are better suited to the beginner.",53
"Dire, absolutely dire. If you like the following; A. Spending longer endlessly searching the forums for answers than anything else and still not necessarily finding them B. Wasting time getting the right answers only for an autograder to decide an answer that hasn't been touched for an hour and was right, is suddenly wrong (not a great advert for a language you want to use to automate this, is it?) C. Reading countless posts voicing a lot of similar frustrations to this D. Lectures so brief you may as well not bother E. Interpreting ""assumes some knowledge of other languages"" as ""you best be great with these other languages because these lectures won't really help you"" F. Wasting yet more time on the forums where answers to one post go totally off track so you're left hunting for a needle in a haystack of replies for something that may or may not be of relevance. If these things are truly your bag then this is the course for you. If not, then do yourself a favour, go elsewhere and find a different course.",53
"This course is a real waste of time! Please avoid!!The lecturer in general teaches nothing. He explains some basic concepts. You can learn them in a 5 minutes YouTube video. Then, you should answer the detailed/technical coding assignments. The assignments have nothing to deal with the lectures. The lectures have zero to very limited coding explanation. Then, there is an outdated picky auto grader that grades your work. You will spend hours finding out that your code is correct, but the auto grader works with libraries very old versions. I learned nothing from the lectures but I passed the assignments with 90, thanks to StackOverflow and online resources.I am wondering who gives this course 5 stars. Fake reviews? ",53
"As a beginner,This Course theory is very good and can be understood with a little of Python Basic Programming skills cuz of the 1st week notebook and theory provided.and coming to the other weeks,the theory was good but short and faster explanations ends you up in a dilemma.I personally feel that this course is highly recommended for the purpose of 'THEORY ONLY' != 'Assignments'. If you want to work on assignments you'll end up loosing your mind,and for the assignments I recommend people to just checkout Stack Overflow or the discussion forums or Github to answer them.Definitely You won't be able to grasp everything in here,so I prefer and refer you people to checkout courses on 'PANDAS' to work explicitly.",53
"I was quite disappointed by the almost total inaccessibility of the staff in the discussion forums, the unconquerability of the autograder for most of the assignments (losing points for no discernible reason, with all resources exhausted), the lack of a stats module for the specialization, and the lack of education, really. There is value in asking students to learn on their own, but this course goes much too far with that, giving problem sets that are virtually unsolvable without prior experience in data wrangling in R or some other data language. This leaves serious, hardworking students with little choice but to troll the forums for solutions. Hardly the best way to learn the intricacies of this subject.",53
"I have loved using Coursera to learn Python and have really enjoyed the Python University of Michigan courses I've taken so far. Unfortunately, this is not one of those courses. There is no accompanying textbook or reading, only videos and then practice code. The instructors in the videos don't provide any explanation of the syntax, and simply tell you what the code says which you can already clearly see. Basically they read the course syllabus and the lines of code to you and provide no explanation, i.e. ""today we're talking about lambdas, here is code where we're using that."" You may as well google articles about each topic in this course and you will probably gain more understanding of these concepts. ",53
"I have a decent knowledge of python, this course tries, initially to introduce Pandas.  In my opinion, the way they try to do is bad.  The material is not available, so, no way to reproduce on the student side the examples.  During the course, there are also some small checkpoints to see if the example were clear enough.  Honestly, without data sets, without proposing (many) exercises, it seems all useless.  They expect that the students get everything immediately (they claim that you don't need to know the lambda function, but expect you to get in in 2 minutes of a lesson).  I discontinued this.  I will check for other materials, books, and more to deepen my data science knowledge in python. ",53
"This course is a really bad introduction to Data Science. You do not learn how to code for Data Science, they just give you a list of functions without really teaching you how to use them. Then in the tests you get tested on a lot of things that were not explained and you end up searching how to do most stuff on Stack Overflow. I came here to learn stuff in an organised way, not to learn function after function. The things tested in the exams should be about what you teach, and not whatever you want. This course asumes you have a background in Python and also a background in using it for Data Science, which basically means it is not an introductory course.",53
"I wouldn't recommend this course to people who only read the material and answer the exercises, I wouldn't recommend this course at all!!, Run and don't look back, if you want to learn pandas libray (that is the focus of this course) better go to other courses because the material lacks the deepness necessary to pass the course. If you like to learn purely by yourself and read past threads from forums to resolve your doubts then this course can expand your knowledge of the pandas library and managment of data in the python language but at cost of your time, pain and sweat of trying to understand in the first place why you took this course.",53
"Very disappointed and honestly shocked that this course has the rating it does.I enrolled in this course expecting to be taught.  Instead, I have to pause lectures every few seconds to find a free YouTube tutorial or Stack Overflow article that actually explains the content that the instructor mentioned (because he never goes to a level of detail necessary for what can be reasonably considered ""teaching"").All this leaves me wondering:  Why am I paying for this?I cancelled my subscription to the Specialization after taking a look at Assignment 3 and have no intention to finish the course.",53
"This was my second course with Prof. Brooks as the instructor. I gotta say, both were awful. He expects us to find info on what we are trying to learn, on our own. The assignments are completely different from what we are taught in the videos, which is well, minimal. Pathetic. We have to find new functions on our own to complete the assignments. If I wanted to research all about Pandas library on my own, I wouldn't have taken up this course in the first place! Even in the lecture videos, the professor doesn't even bother to explain the functions properly. ",53
"I really wanted to like this class and was looking forward to learning data science in Python but this isn't the way to do it.  The instructor glosses over material without explaining it and the assignments require a large amount of research and outside learning to complete.  If I have to learn how to do the assignments from Google and Stack Overflow, why am paying for this course?  I've taken other classes on Coursera and am pretty good with Python and self-learning but this is pretty terrible.  Overall I expected better out of University of Michigan.",53
"I found there were a lot of problems with the systems supporting the learning and assessments, namely the implementation of the Jupyter Notebook, which kept on misbehaving (it wouldn't save your work, and then it would stop giving outputs for your code). I ended up wasting a lot of time trying but failing to resolve these technical hitches, and time is the most precious resource for any student / programmer, and so I unenrolled from the course. I am now going to find an alternative sequence of courses to learn about data science along with Python.",53
"This course is  good but instructor is very bad.....  Not providing good course lectures and materials... The lecture is very fast and not covering all the things being asked in the assignment... I am leaving this course due to this.. I have successfully done other python courses, because there, the instructor was very good and his teaching style was awesome... I have wasted lot of my times enrolling in this particular course... Though the course conception is good, instructor and course materials are not up to the mark....",53
"the instruction is very poor: when one decides to learn online, it´s expected that it will have the content related to the subject, and this course does not. The content is just showed, very fast, no details, and there are several tasks to accomplish, the level of them is much higher than what you have gotten in the videos and lectures, so, one will have to do a lot of extra research and learning outside this platform. if the person wants the certificate, ok, but the knowledge will come actually from other sources.",53
"Too much research left for the participant. As one of them, I found no difference between going to Stack Overflow or the official documentation websites to figure out myself how some packages worked, as this was basically the same instruction provided by the instructors. I have decided not to continue further training given by University of Michigan, as there were other specialization that made a far better work increasing the course difficulty. Highly recommended to tag this course as of ""Advanced"" (difficulty).",53
" While i can appreciate the value in getting resourceful at finding information online, this course was essentially 99% google and stack overflow with 1% referencing materials learned in the course.   I spent many hours googling exhaustively for answers and reading through the forum where there were numerous bugs noted by the staff contributors.  The information required for the assignments could and should have been presented better to achieve the same effect without the hours of independent research.",53
This course is heavily dependent on your ability to google methods and techniques because the lectures do not come close to preparing you for the assignments. The videos simply show you what happens when you type certain code into the interpreter and do not go into detail of how it works because they figure stackoverflow already does it. This is probably a course more for someone who already knows the material and needs a refresher vs someone who is trying to learn it all for the first time. Good luck,53
"mal explicado, el profesor no explica los temas, solo los enuncia y tienes que buscar todo el material fuera de la plataforma, lo cual ocasiona que sea un curso muy complicado y que te tome muchísimo mas tiempo del que debería. Yo no siento que sea un curso, lo veo mas como una oportunidad para certificar si ya conoces todos los temas. Como consejo para los que quieren hacerlo, solamente lean las libretas y busquen los temas por internet, el profesor no les servirá de nada. dejo 1 estrella ( MUY MALO)",53
"One of the worst course ever designed. The course name states its an INTRODUCTION to one of the most important field but the assignments were so tough(fine...) and ""teaching still worse"". No proper materials, background, techniques provided, I felt Dr. Chuck would have done this far better. We are expected to know the A-Z of Bible/Geeta for an INTRO course and At last we are made to read documentation and Stack overflow and tell me what's the purpose of this course then??? ",53
"I've taken a few courses on Coursera and Ive found this one to the be the most frustrating. The assignments absolutely do not match up to the material taught during the week, the questions asked during the lectures presumes we have a lot of base knowledge or wants us to look up the answers but does not give us nearly enough of the language to do so. I absolutely feel defeated after trying to do the assignments and find the forums and ""community"" to be less than helpful. ",53
"While this was one of the better courses I've done on Coursera, the start date of the course was changed without any indication of when it would begin.  We've also been waiting months for the next course in the specialisation to begin, again without any communication.  This was a good course, but I would recommend people wait until all the rest of the courses are available before starting this course and beginning the specialisation.",53
"Unfortunately, I won't complete the specialization because of this course and I will look for the content elsewhere, because of the following reasons:1- The videos are not informative and short 2- Assignments only use like 10 to 15% only of the given info from the video3- No slides, hints or tricks are given to help you in the assignment 4- The lecturer needs real life examples and visualization aid to support his teaching method",53
"Assignment 3 was absolutely ridiculous in the sense that the implementation of pandas functions depended on data cleaning in the first step for which there was no help . No response from peers or moderators on my queries. Had high hopes when I joined the course. I feel cheated now. Because of some issues with the data cleaning step, all my following answers were incorrect and I couldn't pass the course in time.",53
"This course is really complicated for a person who is trying to get into the field of Data Science. Don't take this course if you haven't got fluent skills on English as well, because some parts of the explanations are really hard to understand. Take a similar course for a beginner level and then come into this course if you are willing to take this course. Giving out one star because of these reasons.",53
If you are just beginner in python and want to know better about Data Science dont enroll for this course.The lectures are as if the professor is just reading some notes.The annoying background of people moving is a complete disturbance.The assignments and course do not have anything in common.As a whole it would waste your time if you want to learn from the course it is more like self preparation.,53
"Это уже 7й или 8й курс из тех, что я прошла на coursera, и он самый бесполезный. Лекции бесполезны - лектор объясняет непонятно. Для того, чтобы сделать практические работы, нужно самостоятельно изучить документацию по pandas. Я стала ее читать, и поняла, что лектор не только не добавил от себя никаких объясений, он даже умудрился сделать материал еще менее доступным, чем он изложен в документации.",53
There is a huge difficulty gap between the lecture videos and the assignments. The videos are very brief and they do not give you all the tools required to do the assignments which are a lot more complicated for users who have no experience with Panda. Learners are required to search the internet and stackoverflow which defeats the purpose of an online course education as I can do it by myself.,53
"Did not liked it at all, week one quiz is based on some demonstration which should not be a demonstration but actual study of a subject. If quiz is tends to ask practical things they should be practical during first week of the course, I did not came here to watch a video and paste the result in a quiz to pass further, I came for the practical experience provided by the experts in a field.",53
"please provide the complete 5 unit details .  I could see only this unit is open for past many months. I paid for all 5 unit money already and not in a position revert back and get the money.  Could you please help me out to understand when this courses will be available if not in near future , why are they taken money before the course is not ready to us. Quite disappointing experience.",53
"Whilst the course material was great, the actual program is very poorly managed. The assignments and lecture notes are not kept up-to-date meaning you must waste hours in the forums trying to figure out why your assignments are not being graded correctly or why your code is outdated.Not impressed, would definitely not recommend. I ended up having to just teach the material to myself",53
"Terrible course. Material they teach has nothing to do with what you're evaluated on, so I ended up using google more for the assignments than the actual course material. Expect you to basically already know everything they're teaching, so it's essentially useless. They fly through concepts and barely explain anything, so you end up learning nothing.",53
"I expected that this course is useful for my studies but it was not for sure. I felt this course is a revision note for people who have already studied before or had experiences a lot. The teaching were too poor and general. Free study material in the internet is still better than this course. At the end, I thought why would I pay for this course.",53
"I really tried to get into this course. I wanted a more advanced and fast paced course so a lot of the reviews about it being difficult didn't turn me off. However, the course just is not good. The assignments are not conducive to experimenting and learning and I got almost nothing from the lectures which were basically dry lists of facts. ",53
"The course provided minimal instruction and relied on self teaching. The easiest solutions to the assignments weren't covered during the weeks lectures, and had to be found through self teaching. This would be a great free course. Paying for it was a waste of money as I could have learned everything I did from my own teaching. ",53
"The videos are extremely short and do not feel as if they have the assignment in mind, the lectures do not teach you much compared to what you teach yourself trying to get through an assignment. The majority of time completing this course is spent reading through documentation and other external resources on your own. ",53
The description of the course is really bad. Youtube videos are better than the course. I am just doing this course for the sake of the certificate. I had to do everything by my ownself watching youtube videos and reading other material on the web. The assignments were in NOOOOOO way aligned with the actual lectures.,53
Not recommended until the whole course is updated. Its autograder is very old and invalid. It's also very sensitive. Shows the wrong answer even when the answer is right in the latest version of Jupiter. I hope it gets updated very soon as it's a very important course for data science after all.,53
I thought that applied means we will be coding in python not having notebook and listening about wrote code. Applied was only at assigments. And I really dont like some tasks to read article and write min.90 words disagreed or agreed. Teacher was very good but form of the course not.,53
I understand that the goal of this course is to push us to a higher level of understanding of Python and Pandas. I would rather put my time/energy into real world problems than blindly try to guess what the autograder for this course is looking for.  A big disappointment.,53
Actually I wanted to select zero stars!I never leave reviews but for this course I will make an exception. This is the worst course I have taken period. Instructor  robotically  reading ill-prepared material off a prompter. Save time and money and just use google. ,53
Jupyter notebooks used for assignments work sporadically at best. I've spent about half my time during assignments troubleshooting notebook issues. It has been far more beneficial looking at the official pandas documentation and tutorials than taking this course. ,53
"Might as well just list the assignments, and skip the videos. I don't really feel the videos provide any useful introduction or helpful information about how to solve the assignments, it's basically up to me googling and reading documentation. Very disappointed.",53
"there was a technical problem on submitting the assignment, which I can not proceed on further week's lectures without completing the submission. I sent message and report the problem but nothing has solved even after 10 days. ",53
"Wort course ever. Videos give only sneak previews and don't provide required information for the assignments. If I have to search for the all relevant information in the internet, then I don't need a video course at all.",53
I am really disappointed with the course structure and the explanation. The assignments were really difficult to understand and there were a lot of issues with the grader even though the method and solution was correct. ,53
"The course is not very helpful nor does it cover any of the pandas functionalities in depth. Furthermore, it also uses an older version of pandas leading to what little that was being taught to be even more redundant.",53
The material in the videos is very light. The course does not teach pandas but gives you a small introduction and leave you with the assignment. If I have to search for every thing what is the purpose of the course?,53
"The level of lectures is unacceptable. Everything is strictly read from paper to the camera. All of the skills I've got were thanks to my own online research, as the explanaition of the lecturer was horrible. ",53
Worst course I strongly recommend not going through course. Here the code is executed and he tells briefly and the assignments are the things which come in ahead topics. Not to mention the grader has issues. ,53
"Why didn't you taught the stuff you meant to give in the assessments, if one had to learn independently you could've provided with assignments only. Also too much rush during the programming tutorial.",53
I am spending more time to deal with auto grader issues than learn something. This is so frustrating despite having good course contents. Frustrating and waste of my time and effort and money.,53
"The instructor is the embodiment of monotony - adding to that, his lecutres are lacklustre, uninformative, and the student has to live and breathe on stack overflow for every assignment. ",53
"Lessons were ok but the assignments were really frustrating, not because of the questions itself but because the questions were organised badly or were really vague and confusing.",53
"Not much practice work, one will easily forget the concepts. The mentor speaks and types too fast, most of the time you will lag behind. Its like someone is reading a book.",53
The course lectures hardly covered what was asked in the assignment. For someone who has a full-time job scouting through discussion forums is extremely time consuming.,53
The course contents are great but the instructors are not. I struggled a lot and had to watch a lot of tutorials from other places and finally I learned the contents. ,53
"Explanations are superficial, and it relies too heavily on self-learning. For that I can simply check Python's documentation without paying the course's monthly fee.",53
"There is no helpful guide to the tasks, you don't know the results in advance so you don't know if you are doing well or not.
Tedious and you don't learn anything.",53
"the lectures are not helpful at all, assignments were organised poorly - there impossible to see mistakes, in other words- go  break your head over it",53
The instructor teaches you very liitle and expects you to do thing of your own.It was the worst course i have done until now.The instructor is mad.,53
"The pacing for the course is horrendous, this class quickly becomes impossible to do without looking up answers as the lectures do not help at all",53
"The Course is too general, not going into details of how codes should be written.  In order to pass the assignments you need to separately study.",53
"Unclear assignments, lectures are brief and sometimes unclear.  Spent more time trying to understand what was being asked than actually learning.",53
"The lectures videos were poorly structured, the only good things were the assignment which on its own can teach better than the lecturers ",53
"The course material is good, but the auto-grader does not work properly. Most time on week 3 assignment is debuggin this auto-correcter.  ",53
"Very knowledgeable professors, but very little explanation or actual 'teaching'. Graded assignments require a lot of self-education.",53
Not much information for beginners without a coding background. Assignments are impossible given the video tutorials we have.,53
it is very hard for beginners to understand!! More example type teaching is required than simply dictating the theories.,53
"The instuctor  is too slow and the way of teaching could be made more interactive and interesting , like CS50 of Harvard ",53
teacher is good but talks way too fast. hard to follow especially data science concepts at that speed,53
The Class is too fast and not explained in an understandable manner. Programming is also very fast.,53
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY IT ALWAYS KEEPS REJECTING MY WEEK 2 ASSIGNMENT. WELL I AM NOT TRYING AGAIN NOW,53
Not an introductory course. They don't even teach like you're a beginner. Very very unsatisfied.,53
the teaching materials provided by christopher is too brief. can be improve by more elaboration. ,53
Not a very good instructor or course. Course topics are good. I had to learn from other sources.,53
Very poor material compared to what you are asked to do on the assignments. A waste of money,53
"My project is stuck because of silly code validation, can some one look into it urgently",53
The content they give in the videos is not enough to perform the tasks they propose.,53
"just begun, but so far so good. I will update the stars as the weeks progress!!",53
this class sucks. Huge disappointment after how good python for everyone was.,53
i had some issues which i posted as questions but they remained unresolved,53
It's a shame the course offers no feedback if you don't pay.,53
"SUPER FAST, He talks slow and codes fast..not done dude.",53
assignments are are way too difficult than the coaching,53
The pace is extremely fast. No time for you to think. ,53
Looks like it's prealpha version of what it might be.,53
"very poor content! un-recommended at all, sorry.",53
the autograder is way too picky and frustrating. ,53
there is only a small previes of all topics .,53
Only focusing on library not real application,53
Too much fast. Coding not visible properly.,53
assignment grading process is not proper,53
inthisstartingbasicknowledgeinnotgiven.,53
"  Grader is buggy, really annoying...  ",53
Just Talking and no real teaching,53
No proper explanation of concepts,53
unclear and poorly thought out,53
Very Difficult and Quite fast,53
Too fast. Need to be deeper.,53
I want to drop the class,53
Very bad for a beginner ,53
very tough to catch up.,53

"!!!STOP DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE!!!%100 pure advertising. There is a moment I felt like I learned some thing, but rest of the course I played with x2.0, of there was more I would have get it. Putting this into Specialization requirements is smart from your perspective, you are basically saying if you want to reach Capstone pay me $50 more, but at least fix the typos you made during video, just a little respect to your subscribers. But right now, I highly doubt that Capstone Project will be something serious that I want to mention in my Linkedn. There is also downside of what you do. But since you are in between the top rated courses either nobody uses Coursera anymore or people are silent enough and patient enough.You are all Scientists like me, I'm also biostatistician but I would never ever post a course like this to any platform. I'd rather use Google or Facebook ads to lead people here.If somebody wise enough to get Data Science Course, he should be skillful enough to download R, click next and install it, and R has help for it, shows you step by step. GitHub is free platform, anyone who can signup for Coursera can signup for GitHub, too.I know there is no requirements for this course or specialization course, it is 0 to Scientist but seriously you are talking about R codes, arrays, loops, regression, model fit but signing up for GitHub.Your target group in Coursera is either Data Scientist or becoming one, so they know what the Data Scientist job posts requires. It requires coding blind folded R/Python/Java/one of C family at least 2 of them, hopefully all of them. It requires SQL, MySQL, NoSQL, any kind of SQL or database solution mankind ever used.It requires Math, Statistics, Analytics, Algebra, Finance, Economics + all kinds of computational sciencesIt requires management, social relations, advertising, psychology, anthropology + rest of the social sciences.+++++ it requires LOGIC and NON-ARTIFICIAL HUMAN INTELLIGENCEso we are trying to be that guy, no need to show installing R or GitHub, I'm sure you will do it again doing rest of the Specialization.",76
"Not met what offered. I really don't know why but Instructor was in a hurry and like, he was in the position of instructor by obligation. Maybe, He has knowledge of the subject, but definitely does not have even basic skills of teaching.Because of this course, I am not planning to follow other courses on this specialization. ",76
"This should not be a course. It's just introduction and should be condensed to one video and a handout with pointers to those who need more specific and detailed instructions for setting up their computers. This is not a learning course.  All they teach you how to install git, R and Rstudio.  And they take money for this (if you want to say you ""completed"" the course)!!! Highly unethical practice in my opinion. The surveys are stupid too.  They don't distinguish between those who completed (but not earned any credentials) and those who didn't. In my opinion this is a very dumbed down version of an introduction to a data science course (and not a cours in itself).  Definitely not worth 4 weeks!A much more valuable course is Stanford's ""Machine Learning"" where you can actually learn something (and don't force you out of evaluation if you don't pay).",76
"I missed the entire course deadline just because I stuck in one of week 4 projects - pushing a file into GitHub. When I went to the forum, there are so many people in the same situation. The main reason is that the week 4 video did not cover the project content well. Overall, compared to other programming courses I took on Coursera, this course is not well organized at all! Instructors basically just read words in slides, no interesting examples and no hands-on practices, especially week 4 slides that look like a syntax reference document. So the entire instruction is very boring, making me wonder why I need to sit here and listen to word reading rather than buying a textbook. Also, people coming here to learn it are new learners. When the instruction skipped much and made the content not logical and complete, it is very difficult for us to understand what the video is talking about. That's why in forum there are so many people expressing their confusions.  This entire specialization is the one that I've taken and feel the worst (I got lost in the R course too). I strongly recommend the instructors of this course watch and learn how the instructor of the specialization ""Python for Everyone"" organizes and teaches the content. He makes programming become very interesting and easy to understand. He also provides many hand-on practices to help learners understand abstract concepts. Unfortunately this specialization instruction is just about reading words in the boring slides.....",76
"Although they spend ample time explaining how the course was using technology in order to stay up to date, it was far from it. If you are using a Mac computer, be prepared to google every assignment because the Mac instructions are going to be for an older version. Then I expected to learn about Data Science as a career... not in this class. I feel like I know no more about Data Science than I did when I began. I am probably not going to continue through the entire certificate, and instead learn the languages it suggested were more common - SQL and Python, and pick up the ""Data Science"" somewhere along the way. ",76
"""You passed this course! Your grade is 100.00%.""  

I feel like I have not learned much. Even though I have taken 100%, as you can see above, the course tackles very little programming.

And the final project, it asks to do some activities, but when looking at the forum, I saw that what was talked about, had a level of knowledge that the course had not taught.

But worst of all, was receiving financial help from 1/9 courses. Would not it be for the whole course? They are complementary. What will I do with 1 certified course, which as you can see my complaint above, I have not learned anything?  ",76
"HORRIBLE, SO DAMN BAD!I've done over 50+ courses online from places like Coursera, edX,Udemy and I've never been across a course so bad like this one, the whole content could have been summarized and turned into a one week part inside another course.And the robot voice?! Geez, I understand why, but don't, just don't, it makes us lose the interest in the course, thankfully I have other Data Science certifications and I could do all the tests, but damn, SO SO BAD!",76
Very bad the videos. The automated voice is further disgusting. Further very few classmates so I really had to plead to get my assignments checked by peers and complete the course. When I contacted the coursera support and asked for help in getting peer reviews they made a change and all my progress was lost. I had to get back again and they made my progress back again. overall bad course and worse corsera support. ,76
"It is irritating to hear computerized voice and also reading the files. as this is interactive learning place i do not want to read. Also I might read books reading Data Science Rather than listening your computerized voice or your lecture. So i suggest, for improving learning experience, lectures should be classified in two categories. Dynamic lectures should be tought  by Human.",76
"I appreciate the thought process behind the automation, but there's no way I'm sitting through that monotonous robot voice. I can just get a textbook and read it cover to cover for that sort of education, and I greatly prefer that over listening to that droning voice. ",76
"A lot of common information, no real examples. may be OK os introdaction, but for scilled student useless. Bunch of very short videos  — I'd prefer to see it as a text tutorial ",76
There is imply not much substance here. Everything here can honestly be integrated into other courses or offered as a free overview course of what data science is.,76
This course is more of an overview of what is to come. A lot of what is presented here could just be in the format of a word or PDF with a series of links.,76
"It does nothing better than just a PDF file... I would appreciate if they actually provide a PDF file, so everything is integrated and no loading time.",76
"Very basic stuff and very dull, monotone computer-synthesized voice. The quizzes are also so easy you may as well not take them.",76
Having an instructor narrate is extremely important in a course. The robot that is narrating makes the videos unwatchable.,76
The course contains almost no valuable information. It is not required to spend 4 weeks for it.,76
It is unbelievable how one can learn with this boring automatic course. I can not stand it!,76
I do not like the voice in this course . I will can not continue the course . ,76
Terribly run waste of money! Better off going to Data Camp!,76
It was useless for me; as i have used R studio previously,76
"Low quality, I didn't learn anything really.",76
Bad course. All videos are machined read.,76
I really don't like the automated videos.,76
A lot of information without practice,76
Seemed pretty useless to me,76
"The first week has one assignment: a five question quiz that reviews the syllabus, course/program design and purpose.  As someone with multiple degrees and a PhD significant other - both of us work, and are successful, in data analysis and research.  My career is centered around Business Intelligence.  I was hoping to engage a program that would help me develop R programming skills and build my skill set.  After watching all the videos twice, taking notes, completing almost five hours of online research into the topics that I encountered during my first attempt at the quiz, having my significant other review the topics & questions with me, I still failed to pass the quiz after ten attempts.  Hence, a syllabus quiz is my roadblock to moving forward in the program.  This is not pride, I am not imagining myself to be a genius who is insulted by this failure.  Frankly, no one is stupid enough to have not been able to comprehend a syllabus and course desi",76
"most part of this course is a duplicate of the ""R programming"" course.microphone/sound of the teacher quality is very bad.not original, boring, dividing this in ""4 weeks"" is too ridiculously long, this should be done in 1 week to enable users to take more time for the ""R programming"". this course should be free. don't lose too much time on it, it's doable in a day or a weekend and move on to ""R programming"".asking for so much money to see how to install R and github is a shame.feels like this course has been added just to have a round number for the specialization.even the survey in the end asking for feedback starts with a question not adapted to moment it's been asked ""did you get a certificate?"" of course i did not as i've just finish the course and now wait for my peers to review my final submission.",76
"I am sorry but the robot-based voiceover, extremely slow pace, and lack of interactivity made this specialization unbearable. Additionally, choosing R over Python seems illogical for many reasons, such as Python being the #1 language for data science, ML, AI (if you'd ever consider specializing in these areas).Poor experience - gave up after the 3rd week and started the one from Michigan (applied data science w/ python).",76
"Git should be introduced more slowly, over multiple courses. I cannot possibly absorb all the command line instructions that were mentioned in the class. There are just too many.Please PLEASE *PLEASE* spread out the course content on Git over 3 or 4 courses, so we can practice it as we submit assignments. I forsee numerous wasted hours fiddling with Git Bash trying to make it work, not knowing what mistake I'm making.",76
"$38 is a lot to pay for tutorials about how to install software. This course takes only 20 minutes to complete. It is also obsessed with command line interfaces. There's a reason that they were left behind in the 80s. It does cover GUI software like Rstudio, which is ignored for the rest of the course. How about something on the desktop Github version? https://desktop.github.com/ So much easier to use.",76
"Quizzes were based off of extremely high level overview videos not covering anything specifically or deep diving into anything. When applying the git commands covered, numerous errors arose. Overwhelmingly academic course with very little hands on. This is not for anyone actually looking to work in this field, but for someone looking to be able to talk about this field.",76
"No value as a stand alone course, as completing it provided no more knowledge, skills, or attitudes than, say a 15 minute Ted Talk would. May help prepare me for other courses in the Data Scientist Specialization, but it's difficult to say until I complete those courses. I may come back and change this review after completing other courses in the specialization.",76
"While it's amazing to save costs and resources by creating automated voice-overs, it would be helpful if commands on the screen match what is being said. It was quite challenging going back and forth between lecture videos and lecture notes to copy and paste commands. I find it time-consuming, and I hope this problem can be rectified for future classes. ",76
"Very short and just a basic overview on how to install a few tools that most of them I already had installed. All this course content could be packed into an introductory lesson instead of having to pay for it. I abandoned the specialisation because of this, I know it's a big business but at least you need to offer some value for the money",76
"I have absolutely no idea how could this become a separate course - and one spread over 4 weeks. It is extremely basic, extremely general and extremely high level. It should be compressed to 1-2 hours and added as an _optional prerequisite_ to other courses in this specialization. I personally feel cheated out of my 29 USD.0.1 star.",76
"They charge you to take a class that explains how to install a few programs. If you go to the program's websites, there is directions to install it anyway, so this was completely unnecessary. Waste of money. This class should give you some early training on R before throwing it at you in the next course without enough training.",76
Worthless course. There should have been no need for this course and the fact that they charge money for this is disappointing. This module could have been easily merged with the next module (R- Programming). Just a few pages with instructions on how to install the required softwares and repositories would have sufficed.,76
"I don't have comment on the data scientist's toolbox. However, the payment mechanism of coursera is terribly designed.I was continually paying the course without pre notice. The worse thing is, the coursera doesn't return the money after I cancel. At the same time, they don't allow me to enter the class. Really terrible.",76
"This course was a loss of time and money. Except from week 3 material, the rest can be found on the internet and should be required by everyone who wants to take that specialization. This course doesn't worth it, it's just to take extra money from anyone who wants to learn about Data Science.",76
"I had a very bad experience with this whole course set-up. Especially the peer-grading, you have no insight on why they assigned this score to you - nothing.. ..especially when you know you did your course work correctly.. i will never come back to coursera.. waste of money !!!",76
"Complete waste of time. This should be a course on its own, and much less be charged for. This should have been the 1st week of an actual class. This only dealt with installing a couple of software tools. Hopefully the following courses will teach something worthwhile.",76
"Very bad course so far. Very little detail and Assignments are very hard to solve. Worst $500 dollars spent in my life, and the course isn't worth even $10!I'm an online instructor myself and the quality of the course isn't worth its price!",76
A simple list of programs that needed to be installed would cover 90% of the course content.  Some of this content is also repeated in other courses in the sequence.  If you have any technical skills this entire course is extremely tedious.,76
"Although the content is correct, quality models videos and materials is very low, wanted to make all the specialization, but I'm not satisfied with the quality of the course. It's a shame, because the JHU is an excellent University",76
"If you are doing this for certification then go ahead, but if your intention is to learn then this is not a good course. Its absolutely basic and most stuff you can find online without spending any money. Wouldn't recommend.",76
"In my opinion, most of this information should be free and available as a pre-req. for other classes (installing R Studio).  It was cheap, but in general, I thought I was going to be more out of this course than I did.
",76
Students generally move towards online course to hear a human explaining them those concepts. This new technique may be time saving for you but it was really annoying and unexpected (almost everything )  ,76
$40 is way too much to spend just to learn how to install a couple pieces of software and sign up for a GitHub account. The entire course should have been the first week of the following course.,76
Is this a real course for a data scientist just installing shit and a peer reviewing for that screenshot and forking all repos ...very bad not worth to be with rest course in specialization,76
Good time of day! This course is great! But I can't finish it as I missed deadlines and can't switch session!!! I missed 1 month already because of this bug:(It's so frustrating...,76
Me inscribí en el curso y solicité una ayuda económica porqué supuestamente se dictaba en castellano. Pero esto no es cierto y no puedo avanzar. Por eso mi calificación en baja.,76
Too basic content.I have not learned anything with this course (installing R and RStudio should not be part of exercises or lectures).I hope R programming course will be better,76
"This is pure theoretical course, It's look like a Power Point presentation. Students can not easily understand this.I do not recommend this type of teaching on Coursera",76
"Some interesting concepts, but way to simplistic in my opinion. Only reason I see to pay for it is the fact that it is a requirement in the Data Science Specialization",76
Do not take this course if you want to get a job in industry. Python now dominates industry and R is basically obsolete. I will be switching to a course in Python.,76
"Certainly not worth paying for this course, only talks about how to install the tools. Not able to take quizzes when you try to take the course for free. ",76
"Good introductory course. However, an overkill as a separate course (and hence charging $30 for it). Courses 1 and 2 could have been clubbed together.",76
"It has almost no content and isn't actually useful. I've heard later classes in the series are way tougher, so the ramp up isn't at all good.",76
"Not really enough content to be a course in it's own right, should be additional material as is useful, but definitely not a requirement.",76
"It is really basic course, I expected much more even if this is offered only for $29.. (the cheapest course in the specialisation)",76
I think a few people like to hear the mechanical voice. Some videos have really low resolution and it is hard to see the codes. ,76
"Eu achei o site desorganizado, não sei se concluí ou não o curso. Não sei se executei todas as tarefas ou não. Decepcionante",76
Completely useless. Just a number of boring videos of what you may possibly learn in Data Science Specialization.,76
Not worth the price. Extremely basic stuff spread very thin over too much time just to be able to charge for it.,76
Useless. The information content is close to zero. Just some blah-blah and a long tutorial to install software.,76
Way too basic for the price - almost no content - this is just setup - I resent paying for setup instructions.,76
Horrible explanation regarding push and pull requests. Would not recommend this course to my friends.,76
Poorly organized. Poorly communicated. No reliable source of assistance with technical problems.,76
"An online non-credit course authorized by Johns Hopkins University and offered through
Coursera",76
The courses are not by a real instructor/professor but are scripts read out loud by a machine. ,76
"The course does not warrant the price, it has way too little information. Very dissatisfied.",76
It's a course which is designed to preview the other courses. It could easily be eliminated,76
This course could be summed up in one page or so. Very little content.GitHub lessons good.,76
The robot voice is terrible. This needs to be fixed. I wish it was an actual person. ,76
"By far to expansive for what you get. Anyway, thanks for the hint about swirl.",76
"Horiible, me volvieron a cobrar un cuando ya lo había terminado.  Una estafa ",76
Automated voice was terrible. - I didn't even last through the first video.,76
This course was extremely exciting for me. I enjoy every bit of the course.,76
Not worth 29$ considering you could take away very little from this course.,76

I didnt like the idea of automated videos. Doesnt works for me.,76
"I just made me install R, R Studio and a repo on Git. Thats it. ",76
"I was expecting 4 weeks of work, but it was more like 4 hours.",76
Too compact and short. Should be integrated to other courses. ,76
nothing special here... the real stuff begins next course...,76

"I have a rudimentary background in R programming and a lot of experience with computers.  I really doubt that someone with no programming experience would be able to complete this course.  In many instances, the tools and functions needed to compete programming assignments were not taught.  In addition, functions that are taught in the class are not used at all in the homework.  The final assignment was unncessarily complicated and time consuming.  I would not recommend this class to someone who is new to programming.",162
"This course lacked organizational structure. The lessons were not in a logical progression and the material jumped around a lot. Furthermore, once a topic was introduced in a video lesson, the practice did not correspond to the lesson just learned. This made it hard to reinforce what was just learned. I would not recommend this course to someone with no experience with R. ",162
"I have programmed in SAS before (15 years ago), so I thought that experience would be sufficient for me to take this class.  I have to say it is not.  This class is definitely not for beginners - you must have programming experience, R experience and/or both.  The programming exercises do not follow the lectures and it does not build upon concepts.  You will be required to seek help elsewhere (i.e., Stack Overflow) and answers to your questions will take days, if not longer.  So, the fact that the classes are organized by week means that you will not conclude in the time you believe you will.  I feel that this class is more self-taught than anything else.  I have decided to quit this class as it has become extremely frustrating.",162
"Very steep learning curve, especially in the beginning. the professor does not have a very engaging way of presenting his material. Also unfortunately he always requires to first think theoretical and then apply some of the learned content this for yourself. However teaching works the other way around:1) what is the problem we are facing?2) how can we solve that problem (practically)?3) how and why does this solution work (theoretically)?this is proven to be much easier to learn new things and get started. Instead i think this course is set-up for people to struggle by themselves, which i find very frustrating and its not teaching! I ended up teaching myself through trial and error and lots of google search. So what am i paying you for then?Disappointing",162
"I learned a lot, but 1 star because most of the HMW are extremely hard compared to the lessons,  and has nothing to do with the lesson, they need more smaller and easier HMWs . The class need to be structured better. ",162
The material poorly prepares you for the assignment and expects a deep commitment to a single part just to solve it. I was unable to find help in the forums or online despite doing well on the quizzes and other work. Terrible course.,162
Damn near worthless. The course material has significant gaps of information. The programming assignments require knowledge that isn't presented in the course. I had to Google my way through this entire course. I would not recommend it.,162
Videos are difficult to follow along due to speaker.,162
"Honestly, I'm very disappointed with this course. The content taught in this course is not in accordance with the assignments. It is like someone taught to be a builder and asked to build the Brooklyn Bridge ... Not fair at all.If you are going to ask to build a bridge, teach me how. If you teach me how to be a builder ask me for a wall, not a bridge. ",162
"If I wanted to learn from outside source and ""hack"" my way through understanding, I would not be paying money for this course. I am paying money as I expect a smooth introduction and summary to the topic which it is not. I have taken classes in SQL and python on courser. Those were of better quality. I think this R class is one of the worst.",162
"At first glance, the lectures seemed great - they explain the chosen lecture material well and give you a good background on the basic building blocks and theory of R. The quizzes were also pretty good because they directly test you on the lectures and help reinforce the key ideas.The problem with this course is the assignments. While the assignments are well-made in themselves and would otherwise help you learn by doing, they have little to no correlation with anything covered in the lectures for that particular week - or, if they do, it is not made sufficiently clear, even in hindsight.This is not a fatal flaw learning-wise, because you can dig around in the forums/elsewhere on the internet for tutorials and explanations of the concepts you need to do the assignments, and through this you can still learn the intended material. I do feel like I've walked away from this course having learned what the instructor meant for me to learn about R.But it does beg the question - if 80% of the essential material for succeeding in this course must be found by scouring outside websites and extra articles posted by former students in the forums, then what exactly am I paying for?Furthermore, it seems I am not the only one who feels this way - more than once in this course I found a post from a mentor in the forums containing a random article from elsewhere on the web, with the caption ""many students have said they are confused about [topic], so for the purposes of the assignment, consider this the 'missing lecture' from this week."" For a free course/completely self-taught approach, this would be fine, but as part of a paid specialization, the extremely large gap between the given material and the assessments was deeply frustrating.I understand that to learn programming is, to a certain extent, to learn by doing, and to learn how to take the theoretical information that was imparted in class and apply it to a new or different problem that is presented as an exercise. However, when, after taking diligent notes on all of the week's lectures and completing all 15 extra-credit swirl exercises twice just to make sure I haven't missed anything, I am still left wondering if the assignment in front of me was uploaded to the wrong course by the instructor by mistake, something has gone quite awry in the course design.This course is not unhelpful, but it's not worth paying for.",162
"The lectures are not very engaging, just listening to someone talk about a code is not a good way to learn how to do it. The swirl course is a better option, but it is very basic and in most cases it consists only in copying something that's already on the screen. The gap between what you are taught in the lectures and the assignments is absolutely abysmal and incredibly frustrating. How are we supposed to know how to create complicated functions after just listening to someone say what a function is? I don't think that teaching someone the equivalent to ""2+2=4"" and then asking them to solve Riemann's Hypothesis in the exam is very fair. 
I would not recommend this course.",162
"Roger Peng is regarded as one of the best in the business when it comes to practicing data science, but I found his instruction skills wanting. As someone new to R and new to programming, I found him somewhat hard to follow at times. Nevertheless, I powered through. Unfortunately, when I came to the quiz at the end of Week 2, I found it was drawing on background knowledge that had not been taught in the course. Honestly, unless you're starting with a background in programming, I would not recommend this course.",162
"The instructor appears unprepared to present the material. When presenting it appears that it's the first time he is reviewing the material. This is my first bad experience on Coursera. The last Coursera course I took (SQL for Data Science by University of California, Davis) was great as it appeared that the instructor was prepared with what they were going to present.Coursera needs to vet their instructors' course recordings before allowing them to put forth their material on the site.",162
"I am really unhappy with this course. Coming to R with some background in statistics and SQL, but lacking programming experience, I assumed this would be an introduction. The material in the lectures is straightforward enough, and the swirl exercises are easy to get through and informative, but the assignments are, without exception, based on writing functions in R with basically zero experience. Having no background or frame of reference for best practices in syntax, logic, etc, and very little information in the lectures or supplementary material to help, I found these to be almost impossible to complete. Furthermore, there's no mechanism or provision in the course to review the assignments after they're submitted. So not only did I not feel like I was doing the work correctly, I can't get feedback, and the lecturer doesn't break down the rationale behind the assignment, and how he would have done it or why. In addition, the assignments bear only a tangential relationship to the lecture material. So I would be feeling good coming out of a lecture and going through swirl exercises, only to be plunged into a programming assignment that was far too advanced for the small steps I felt I had taken in my overall competence with the language and material. I don't doubt that someone with better knowledge of programming can get through this stuff, but this class should be reserved for advanced learners only, or maybe be broken up into two courses. I feel like I wasted $49.",162
"This course is extremely poorly constructed and now quite dated providing instruction in only base R. The philosophy underlying the modular system in Coursera is clearly that the subject matter covered in the module relates to the set work for that module. I was only able to complete work for week x after doing the reading for week x+1. It took me some time to discover this strategy, a lot of which was wasted wondering what I was missing, what I had done wrong &c. I'm sure the course fee doesn't mean much to most but it is a significant amount to me and I felt let down. Very little time or thought has gone into the structure of this course. It is clear that something is wrong with the week 3 assignment when there are git hub entries on the background knowledge required to complete it. Without these I would not have managed. Going by the age of some of these entries, this problem is now years old with no attempt made to rectify it.My only reason for persisting with the course is that my boss asked me get the certificate. I imagine his assumption was that the quality must be high given the institution sponsoring it. It seems to me this course is risks causing a significant amount of reputational damage to Hopkins by association. I won't be continuing with this series of courses, I have switched to a related course series offered by Duke. The quality is incomparable. ",162
My overall evaluation for that course is 1 stas due to main two reasons:First of all course has too much information without the applying during the weeks. However once a learner opens the assignment it is inevitable to face with very hard tasksI spent more time on youtube and other sources to learn how to use the functions and solve the assignments in comparison with the course itself. That is the reason I am not satisfied with the course.Given theory is okay but the applying of them during the week is very less. THat is the reason learner face big issues during quizzes.I found SWIRL assignments very useful that I can say they were the only things that I learned the practical part of R programming.My advice is to increase the number of SWIRL assignments and increase the difficulty level of them each time. It is also better to decrease the difficulty level of assignments and quizzes. Because course is more theoretical than being practical in teaching. but the assignment requirements are more practical.,162
"One of the most worthless courses I have ever taken! There are so many gaps in the course material that you will sepnd the majority of your time banging your head against the table wondering what and why something in the code is happening. The Material on Loops and Functions is a joke! You are supposed to learn loops from that? Maybe if you already know a programing language, you can, but is suposed to be a beginners course, as it was announced whe I started it. Also dont expect much exercises. Swirl is nice to play around, and there is a quiz, but that does not come even close to having a comprehensive set of Exercises. The Instructors advice when there are gaps: Google it! I dont need to enroll in a paid course (for beginners) to do that. Pathetic!",162
"Don't expect so much... Lexical scoping will probably not be used by the majority of data scientists but the course expects you to research it yourself entirely and spend hours on hours on it, when the focus could have been placed on somewhere else!""Mentors"" are quick to respond to dissatisfaction at the course with comebacks but when students ask for help regarding assignments they are nowhere to be seen. Watch all the lectures, enrol for 7 day trial, submit assignment 2 and 4, and ignore the rest. Don't let them trick your money!!! (PS I was like you at the beginning, I thought of paying for the course, doing a good job and getting a certificate, but trust me, this course is not worth it.)",162
"As many others have stated before, the gap between the lectures/swirl practices and the actual assignments is way too big. I am a novice at R but did come with practice of the basics before starting this course. I also took notes and completed every swirl practice. Even with that I felt incredibly unprepared for the assignments. I understand that searching the internet for help is part of the process but the extent to which the student must search is unforgivable for this to be considered a proper way of teaching. I would also caution that the estimated hours of completion are understated if you plan on trying to actually complete these assignments by yourself.",162
"This course is frustratingly bad. The lecture topics are very scattered and provide almost no practical information. The slides are static with simultaneously too much and too little to understand how to apply them ""in the real world."" The disparity between the lecture material and assignments is truly laughable and -- if you are a beginner -- more or less impossible to complete without lots of Google/stackoverflow searching and head scratching. I would not recommend this to anyone.",162
"This is probably the most pedagogically inept course I have ever enrolled on. Although the content is what you would hope to find in such a course, the delivery of it is outrageously bad. When to complete your assignment, Google becomes your best friend rather than your lecture notes, you know that something is wrong. The idea that a baby thrown in the water may just learn to swim rather than drown is pedagogically retarded. Unfortunately, this seems to be the approach here...",162
"The gap between tutorials and assignments is huge. They teach you algebra I and then expect calculus. I got by because of google searching. It took a long time, and it was very frustrating. This course could have been better if there were intermediate assignments to help close that gap. I'm not sure why they've done this already. Based on the discussion sections, I can tell that a large percentage of people quit the data science specialization after taking this course. ",162
"the content of the course is rather irrelevant of the assignments, at least in terms of the hardness... also the presenter is substantially fast. ",162
the lectures are very shallow and lack good code examples. The programming assignments are too hard. The worst course I have ever seen.,162
it's not good to explain only without practice or giving examples ,162
"the instructor is like this is ABCD.., and the assignment is like write a report on a topic. the course is too hard for a beginner, then the instructions are confusing.",162
实在是大大低于我的期望，教学内容和作业完全脱节，使得学生花费了大量时间自己没有头绪的学习，课程本省较为枯燥乏味，缺少实际操作性的演示，大部分是概念性和理解性的知识点，实际操作价值不大。,162
"I really cannot recommend this course for lack of its structure but as I have decided to do the specialization now I cannot stop. Quizzes are good and test the depth of concepts we understood in lectures but programming assignment fails everything. It feels like lectures are made by a person and assignments by a completely new person with a lack of communication. A strong suggestion from being new to programming is that consider the lectures as per the assignments you have made. Programs required to complete the assignments include functions that have not been covered in the lectures nor have they been provided in any supplemental or suggested reading. Assignments are mean to implement what we have learned in the lectures and readings. But the codes required to complete the assignments either have not been taught or mentioned with good references. People with prior programming experience can adapt to it but me being new to it struggled a lot. Especially on week 3 and week 4 programs. I literally had to do filter and sort data in excel to be able to answer some questions in the programming assignments. Please refer course on ""Strategic Leadership and Management"" by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Coursera. There is such an amazing interrelation among assignments and teaching that it makes you want to go further and also try to read or work around more. Please first consider the assignment you want students to complete and then design the lectures. For the week 3 program, I learned after lots of googles to use the argument 'pattern' in the read.csv function. It's really frustrating to solve those programs without a proper understanding of functions. I hope you make the changes as after completing this course even we can utilize it. Thank you for your efforts.",162
"I would not recommend this course to anyone. I enrolled in this course because I am familiar with statistical analysis and wanted to become more adept at using R, and this course was very disappointing. The lecture material and practice assignments in Swirl are nice, but they leave you totally unprepared to complete the quizzes and assignments. There is a massive leap in difficulty from the practice assignments and lectures to the quizzes and programming assignments. Going back over the lectures, practice assignments, and textbook will provide only minor assistance for assignments - there is not enough information to complete the assignment. Because the course resources are inadequate, students must spend hours Googling and troubleshooting in order to finish assignments. An article posted on the course discussion board claims that this is due to the creators wanting to instill a ""hacker mentality"" in students, so they will work to find the answers themselves. While I agree that students should not be spoon-fed the answers, this is a course that charges an admission fee. I took this course because I was looking for resources to learn - if I wanted to spend hours searching random corners of the internet for the answers to R programming questions, I could've done that on my own time at no charge. I feel like I took a basic anatomy course and the first test required me to safely remove someone's appendix. In short, do not take this class.",162
"If you are planning to learn R, then go and buy a book. This course is a complete scam. At least don't pay any money. The reasons; 1.) They advertise that you need couple of hours of study per week. That's a lie, you have to study much more than that unless if you know a little R programming. 2.) The quiz questions are totally unrelated from the lessons. They teach you the basic stuff but they expect you to accomplish intermediate quizzes. 3.) The instructor has no idea how to teach. May be he is trying to prove something.  I couldn't really understand his motives. If you really want to teach that's simple. You do couple of extra videos and teach whatever you are asking in quizzes, or tell us to read a certain material. He didn't do any of them which means he either doesn't know how to teach or this specialization is a complete scam.4.) And I don't really understand what coursera is doing by the way? What kind of a business model is this. I was planning to enroll many specializations but now I am not going to do it. So think about how much they are loosing. Where is the quality assurance. Just because one guy comes up to you and say that he teaches this and that do you believe them? MY ADVICE TO YOU: DON'T PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS SPECIALIZATION. AND FOR ANY OTHER COURSE READ THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST (WHICH WAS MY MISTAKE). ",162
"The materials in this course are very poorly thought out.  (Content of lectures does not match quizzes and assignments, for example. This is obviously intentional, as what the course calls hacking skills is emphasized. By this they mean googling things and figuring stuff out on your own. However, this course gets you barely a step above buying a book on Amazon and just having at it. Yes, the course is nearly free, but your time is valuable.)  For example, the unit on missing values explains NA and NaN, but does not mention complete.cases, which is the one you need for the assignment. It's only like a 5 minute video, so why not cover that as well?Worse than that, the assignments and quizzes are deliberately designed to trip you up.  You will think you have fulfilled the assignment and then when you get to the quiz you realize that you cannot answer the question using the code you wrote because now you are  being required to add extra bells and whistles. This process is demoralizing and is obviously intended to make the learner feel as though they are at fault for struggling, when in fact at no time is the learner informed that the educational materials provided are intentionally insufficient.Underlying all of this is a weed-them-out educational philosophy that really has no place in the 21st century.",162
"I only took the first week, and then I quitted. I took the first-week course twice. The first time I took it--I thought it was my problem--because I haven't code for many years so I can't follow with it. Then I took it the second time and realized that it is not me, it is the course itself. It is so poorly structured!!!!! There are a lot of concepts in the first course, like objects, vector, list, sequence, attribute, class, integer, etc. You might ask me why I listed those concepts which are not structured. It is because the instructor taught those all at once! I wanted to ask if you know how to structure your course! We also know that at the beginning of a course, you should give an overview first, and then structure the notions before you dive into details. You should introduce the notion of the object first. and then introduce the attributes of objects, among which class is one of the attributes. Then introduces that the most basic object is a vector. and then introduce different formats of vectors, and how to create them. My Coursera experience has been disturbed by the courses in this specialization very much. I feel shame about your instructors. ",162
"I had really high hopes for this course.  I am not a programmer, though in college I learned C, C++, and used MATLAB a fair amount.  I wanted to learn R because it is a free software versus paying a licencing fee to use SPSS which I have done in the past.  I had already completed the first week of the course and the first week in this course.  I went through the slides and I didn't really feel like I learned any actual programming so then to expect to answer questions where you had to program seemed a bit out of left field.  As a comparison it felt like they had an hour worth of slides talking about different trees and how to differentiate them then asked you to drive a tank.I then took the time go through two swirl assignments which I hoped was going to fill in the many gaps left by the slides.  They were definitely more helpful than the slide show, but I still felt like they would teach you how to add then ask you to multiply.So in general my recommendation would be not to take the course unless you have a fairly solid understand of programming, otherwise you will do what I did and just wasted $50.",162
"Terrible course. The contents, thrown as a videocast dumpout, have nothing to do with the assignments. Remember this is a beginners' class. eg. on Week2, the elements or functions necessary to carry out the assignment are simply not taught, and despite the excellent SWIRL and doing over the entire course ( in case I missed something)  I was irretrievably stuck. As many have been if I judge by the forums. What is the point in teaching a beginner's courses to beginners and then applying  Graduate school thinking that just discourages?  for me this is just an excuse for poor and unfocussed teaching. I suggest to be very wary of the  J.Hopkins school course moving forward, they don't deliver a  course that meets the expectations: in real life,  when a student is stuck, you help out, at least you highlight the course material:  which of course can't be done here, because the course material is NOT related to the  Assignment.  as has been pointed out numerous times in the forum. Shameful  teachingMarc Messier, PhD.Course  teachers  ",162
"Very poorly constructed. There are major jumps in the difficulty of material that are completely unnecessary. The material could very easily be broken down into more manageable and comprehensible chunks. There is no repetition of any exercise or function to engrain any of the material. This course suffers grossly from the ""curse of knowledge"". If it were structured in a way where (a) material was broken down into smaller bits, ideally as beta tested by true rank novices and (b) all materials or specific functions were presented with repetition, similar to how khan academy structures its math section, then this course would be much better. I would also assume, given a and b, that there would be higher retention and comprehension. The expected time requirements are also wildly amiss. Try beta testing this on TRUE rank novices. The program suggests that this is for ""beginners"". I find it doubtful that a true beginner would fare well in this course.  ",162
"A University Course should be a place where you advance your knowledge with a ""limited and reasonable"" amount of time spent in the course. The role of instructors should be to ""invest"" the time to provide the concepts and information for the students of the course to ""learn"" faster than if they had to research (the planet) by themselves to find the knowledge. The information provided by instructors therefore must be ""accurate and complete"". This course has so many ""incomplete"" pieces of information, that it requires insurmountable amounts of time to ""find"" the concepts required to apply the knowledge, hence it becomes a gigantic ""time waster"". Unfortunate! the tool and the concept of data science is necessary, but a course organized this way is only for ""full time students"" that have only one obligation, study. This course as it is should not be in Coursera.",162
"This course is a joke. The concepts of the language are not explained, the assignments - which are very simple conceptually - cannot be done with what is taught up to the week, materials are poorly structured. (Eg. when class is introduced its operators, properties, etc should be mentioned right away.) The point of taking a class is to get guide to move forward fast, save the time spent on reading forums, walking though books of hundreds of pages. This class will save you no time at all, but causes a lot of frustration.  (Eg.: to cast a character in a data frame (used in the 1st assignment) is done by as.numeric(as.character(char)), instead of as.numeric(str) which seems natural to me.  There must be a reason why you need to cast(?) the char to character before casting to numeric, but the instructor thought it wasn't worth to mention.) Don't take it.",162
"Don't take this course unless you have a programming background. Week 2 has a programming assignment that is way to advanced for students without any programming knowledge. This assignment deals with functions, where the code is complicated. What's unfortunate is that you have to finish ever assignment, including this impossible assignment (for beginners) to get recognition for the course. I spent most of my time researching other sources for information because the lectures, and the supplemental information given on a different site, by the instructor (which indicate knowledge that the lectures are insufficient) give trivial examples when the programming assignments are anything but. This course needs some serious adjustments, either with the prerequisites needed for success in this course, or with the material within the assignments themselves. ",162
"Coming from a PhD student who is by no means dumb, this course is terrible! Too much theory with little to no examples/sample exercises. You will see a symbol once and expected to remember it for future assignments. Speaking of which, the assignments are 10 times harder than the theory and examples shown. If the lectures talk about doing something with a vector of numbers going from 1 to 10, the final assignment will ask you to do that same thing but with several different data files with their own rows and columns of data. You're basically being asked to swim (not even run) shortly after being shown how to crawl. Terrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone who cannot pick up on this stuff quickly. My main regret is I quit few days after my monthly payment so unfortunately that's money I'm never getting back. ",162
"there is a huge distance between what you teach in the videos, which is fine, and the programming assingments which seem to be apt at an expert audience. to solve these problems I have to spend hours and hours on the internet looking at other people doing similar projects or asking for help. I agree that by looking you can get insight into what you are doing, but the lessons need to be built little by little and supported by practice.You can't slam me with these cache problems giving me an example that is hard to understand (much harder than anything seen during class) and expect me to do it in 5 hours per week. Maybe 5 hours per day. Disappointed. I wanted to use the whole course to learn about rprogramming but I will most likely try to get back the money I spent on this and let it go.",162
"The video lectures will help you to pass the quizzes, as they are primarily theory and background. The lectures will not, however, aide you in any way in completing the programming assignments. The first programming assignment is extremely difficult and very little is done in the lectures, the textbook, or in swirl to pull all of the pieces together prior to the first programming assignment/quiz. There are so many disparate concepts, that it would be nice if the instructor could at the very least, demonstrate a full analysis of some kind of tabular data in R. How to properly import the data, create the file, structure the data, and then perform some analysis. These concepts are introduced throughout the course, but never brought together in one complete project. ",162
"I managed to complete this course, but that was because of my four years of ""MOOC-level"" ""programming experience"" and duckduckgo (~google), not because of the course material. Videos are dull readings of the pdfs, with many ""ummmm""s and annoying lip-clicks.  Examples are useless, explanations are often vague or even incomplete. The assignments are relatively hard in that you don't get all the necessary info from the course, sometimes even R's own manpages aren't enough. (Which is a shame, as you'd expect a course to teach you how to use the tools you will need for the assignments.)If you have no programming experience, stay away from this course!Otherwise, if you want to learn R, look for other resources, and save yourself some time and money.",162
"Although the information on the course states that it requires no prior programming knowledge, that statement isn't accurate. You will quickly become lost in the assignments and questions as they are a not a logical progression from the lecture material. The instruction from Mr Peng is all over the place and doesn't give you a good understanding of the language. I found SWIRL to be 100% more helpful. But looking at the upcoming materials, you need to have a solid background in programming to complete this specialization. Which SHOULD have been told to students prior to them spending money on  the course. I would NOT recommend this course to anyone.",162
"Videos are poorly narrated and are marginally effective: vocabulary + key concepts only. The ""swirl"" exercises are woefully inadequate to prepare students for the quizzes. Foundational tasks (i.e. establishing a valid connection to the sample data)  are conspicuously absent from the guided exercises; leaving too many students to seek help from message boards and google. Lastly, the ""professors"" are completely unreachable: they may as well be dead. After 30 years in the IT industry, I found this course to be profoundly aggravating and a complete waste of my time - I have abandoned this course and bought a ""Teach Yourself"" book instead.",162
"If you enjoy floundering helplessly and feeling incredibly stupid, this is the course for you. Expect a few slides on basic concepts (all of which you need a VERY large screen to read because they seem to all be in 8 point font), and then get flung full force into coding. There are no worked examples. You might as well just buy a Reilly book. My partner and I both wanted to learn R for econometric analysis. He can do more after a 1 day seminar than I can do in a month struggling with this course. I had considered pursuing a graduate degree at Johns Hopkins, but if this is the level of instruction I can expect, then no chance.",162
not the model of learning that is encouraging or sticks. hard for a student (even one who has a programming background) to sit through hours of slides explaining what the functions and definitions in the language do without a layer of use context upfront.The content jumps from specific examples to unrelated specific definitions without carrying a sense of integrating the new knowledge with any past knowledge in the course. the whole course seems disjointed.would have been much more effective as learning through examples and to be taught functions and definitions as they come up in problem solving.,162
"The lectures and Swirl exercises are extremely easy to understand and follow, but then the assignments are incredibly complicated and difficult. The assignments ask for techniques that aren't focused on or even covered in the lectures. The tips offered by Al Warren in the Discussion forum make the assignments possible to do. Since the tips are so critical to understanding and completing the assignments, I think Al Warren's tips should be incorporated as part of the core course. This course needs more time to be covered in depth - it's a lot of ground to cover in just one month, ",162
"Course does not do a good job actually explaining R or training you on how to properly use it. The lectures go over the material very fast and you do not get much out of them, and then the assignments throw complex problems that are very difficult. You spend most of your time Googling to learn it, and I find that I would have learned R better if I just did that to start without this course. Maybe if you aren't new to R and have a programming background, it may not be so bad, but if you are new to R and not an experienced programmer, this is not the class to take to learn it. ",162
"i generally think the course needs a lot of improvement as after week 1 the assignments and quizzes don't seem to relate to the course content. we are at very different levels so a more gentle easing and explanation of ideas is necessary other than this apparent quantum leap from one stage to the next. i have had to do a different course else where and i am getting the sort of good introduction into the R language, its not practical to expect everyone to understand the ideas in 4 weeks.programming is hard enough as it is.",162
"This course is outdated and the fact that they don't teach you essential libraries like diplyr, tidiverse and ggplot2, makes it harder thant it should be. Learning R should be fun and easier by learning this powerful libraries. Also the lectures are just plain slides with little to no value. They won't teach you the tools you would need to do your assignments so there is a huge gap in difficulty between the material of the courses and the assignments. This is a big struggle for newcomers into R. ",162
"I somewhat resonate with the content expressed in the blog: https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Coursera-Data-Science-Specialization-Track1, Not Beginner Friendly, better you are already in the position of Analytic field, Statistician, 2, Instructor read out the slide and I don't feel connection in learning, I resolved to other website for better understanding. 3, However, I would give credit to the only mentor (Len), who is really helping, explaining things in simple way. ",162
"Exceptionally bad course and worse instructor. I started this course with lots of interest in R and the way it is taught has made my interest much less now. Why is that?the way videos are explained does not mean anything, It actually makes it harder to understand. the course assignments are very hard and one cannot do unless one learn on his own. Here is the catch the learn on your own is also not explained in the course. The only good thing about the course is the swirl().",162
"R ProgrammingWeek 3Peer-graded Assignment: Programming Assignment 2: Lexical ScopingIn the peer-graded assignment is requested to completed an exercise using an operator never explained in the lectures, nor in the texbook, nor in the swirl package.I don't like this learning method having very light lectures and heavy assignments, this is not the way I like learning as I find it very frustrating not to be able to complete the assignments using the material just learned.",162
"The speaker has his microphone far too close to his mouth so you can hear any(!!!) noises he makes (and he does it a lot!). Further he uses a lot of non necessary commands he does not or just sparsely explain. this would be okay if he wouldnt slip every second sentence or repeat one word several times. He also does not execute code, so you can't see, what the code actually would do. some youtube videos guided me much better than this through basic R. Sad.",162
"This is way too esoteric.  The content was delivered way too fast for me to keep up and process it.  This needs to be taught with more frequent hands on examples.  I'm also not sure why, if auditing, we can't submit and see how we're doing on the learning.  I have no way to evaluate if I'm picking up the concepts or not, which is a struggle.  Overall, I would not recommend this course for R beginners.  I would look elsewhere.",162
"There's a major disconnect from the basic teaching material provided and the first big quiz. All of the actions that need to be taken to complete the quiz is not provided in the lesson material. I understand the interest in teaching people how to look elsewhere for help and learn how to ask questions on forums, however as students in this program will be in their infancy in this program, we do not know what to even ask. ",162
This course is not beginner coding friendly . The assignments contain instructions and code that were not explained in lecture. The first coding assignment has students utilize concepts only found in stickied threads in the discussion board. The second coding assignment also decides to toss another coding function not explained in lecture.  I give this a 1 star based on how unsupported I feel by the lecture material. ,162
"Teacher was super boring and it was difficult to grasp the concepts. I would not recommend this especially to beginners, the course makes it seem a lot more difficult than it actually is, you should try learning from other sources. On top of all that, if what is taught in this course is addition, the assignments are on Laplace Transforms. I had to do a course from somewhere else just to finish this one.",162
"Instructor routinely introduces new functions while trying to explain another new function, and requires assignment submissions using functions either briefly encountered, or not yet covered. Course would be much improved by using only previously covered functions during explanations, and not blasting many rarely used advanced functions along with more common and practical beginning functions. ",162
"I'm giving this course one star because zero stars is not an option.I wish I had read course reviews prior to beginning. First assignment was tough... but do-able. Second assignment seems straight forward, but the template they ask that you follow contains small tricks which appear to be FAR BEYOND anything touched on in lectures.I'm actually going to fight for my money back, what a scam.",162
"This course was frustrating, the learning curve nearly vertical, the material dense and inaccessible, and the evaluative assignments impossible for new users of R without outside resources. No one should take this course unless they are powering through it for the Data Science specialization. Otherwise, would-be students should just buy an R For Dummies book, and use materials elsewhere.",162
"I did not enjoy this course at all. Even though I work as a software developer, this ""Introduction to R"" was very boring, and the lack of real examples in the lessons made me very confused as to why we do stuff.More over, the assignment level comparing to the content in the videos is too high in my opinion. The only thing I enjoyed through the course was the swirl package.",162
If you read the 4 and 5 star reviews they are people who have R experience already. The only prereq for this course is supposed to be regression experience only. This is definitely a learn completely on your own with the videos and text provided by the actual course completely useless. If you are new to R or any programming at all this course will do very little for you.,162
"In desperate need of an ISD.  Very bad descriptions, the quizzes are not sufficiently built around the lecture content, heavily relies on using an ""optional"" external module which is vastly superior to the actual course content....but the external module is only presented at the very end. Not impressed.  Far too much external searching for unaddressed concepts and ideas.",162
"The worse Coursera course I've ever taken. The videos feel like someone reading the technical documentation to you, the ""interactive"" tutorials are like an 1980s text-only game, and the assignments require massive leaps in ability over what you learned in the lessons. I would call this course ""Advanced-level assignments sure to both bore and frustrate people new to R""",162
"This is one of the worst course i have ever taken on coursera, the assignment is so different from what was taught in class, in fact they have nothing in common and the instructor gulps so much and so frequently and he teaches as if he is in a hurry, if there was a lower rating than 1 star, thats what i would have rated it, i spent months on this course. awful",162
"They say that this course is for beginners, but it's really not! Someone recommended I take this course to get ahead in my career, but honestly it takes hours on end to learn and the slides are unclear as well as lack basic information to learn. I had to use the internet a lot as well as a friend to teach me basic concepts otherwise I would have been lost. ",162
"Death by power point. If you can learn from essentially listening to a pod cast and reading unix type manual pages, then this course is for you! If you're like the rest of the population, then these lecture videos are useless. The only redeeming quality to this course has been the homework, but you can find them online or come up with them on your own.",162
"  There is an incredibly wide difference between the levels lectures and the exercises presented on Swirl and the coding needed to pass the assignments.  This is a huge detriment to the learning objectives of the course.  It seems like the ""lectures are about addition of two numbers"" and the ""programming assignments are like differential calculus"".",162
"Completely lost. This is not meant for rank beginners. Data Camp's free R course has been much more helpful for me than this. It doesn't have the same level of detail as this, but at least I'm not watching an instructor gloss over concepts or ideas that are completely foreign to me as someone completely new to programming.",162
Had the toughest time doing this course. A huge lag between course content and the assignments. Kindly consider upgrading the course content so its better designed for beginners. Or at least consider providing additional reading material or helpful information. This course is hardly becoming of a John Hopkins' course. ,162
"1) The faculty should talk more about the slides, draw on them.  It is hard to follow in the current form.  2) The assignments are not relevant to the learning, except week 4.  3) The faculty speaks too slow.  I listened to him at 1.5x speed.  4) Plotting should have a bigger part in the course.  5) SWIRL is GREAT!",162
"The course lacked overall structure which really impedes learning. There was barely an explanation of why we were learning a particular topic. I believe it might be really helpful to have an overarching project that we work throughout the course, and new topics are introduced in relation to that project.",162
"Only the most basic of instructions for R, which are bland and easily read in the documentation or other free resources. There are very few best practices or real examples to use anything found within. The quizzes and assignments do not match the lecture material and are contrived. Not worth the money!",162
"The lectures never motivated the subject matter.  The material should have been broken up across multiple courses and be introduced as needed.  The course difficulty was highly uneven, expectations from the lectures were noticeably lower than expectations for the quizzes and especially the projects.",162
"Don't do this.Don't waste your time.The instructor teaches you like normal A,B,C,D and the assignments were like go to the moon and come back within half-an-hour. Watch how Dr. Chuck designed his PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY course and the assignments and learn how to design course module .Disgusting !!!",162
"Course has the appearance of being quickly thrown together. Assignments are impossible to complete due to random number generation mismatches. Lecture content frequently does not really help with the assignments, and a lot of the video information is extremely useless in real world applications.",162
"Professor is not good, his English is awful and does not explain in a easy way what he tries to teach.
Content is not organized and tasks are not aligned with the content.I have to say that I won't recomend this course, however, I would like to help to improve this course if you need help.",162
"Very painful training, the contents reviewed in the material will not make you capable to solve the weekly assignments, you will have to learn what you need on your own. To me the only value added of this course is that I will receive a proof that I know how to define basic functions in R. ",162
"The course is misleading - the difficulty ramps up too quickly, with the result that those who do not have a programming background will not be able to keep up. It should be toned down and reworked, or split into two courses. Cramming everything into 4 weeks makes everything too difficult.",162
"The teacher goes very fast with the concepts without really spending much time on each of them. It will be great if instead of covering all things in short amount of time, the teacher could write R code using each type of function in console so that students know exactly what to expect.",162
The gap between the lecture materials and programming assignment is enormous. So much of lecture seem to be on the history and theoretical of R programming that it completely fails to cover the material needed to actually completed the programming assignments. Incredibly disappointing!,162
"Only take this course if you're already familiar with the basics of R programming, otherwise don't bother. The instructor is no help and you'll have to search the internet to complete the required assignments. Don't know about skills but this course sure gave me a lot of stress.",162
The lecture material was very poor in terms of content and barely scratched the surface of the topic. I don't consider that passing this course you will learn anything but the very basics of R programming. In that respect you are better off reading a book on R.,162
"For an introductory course with no prerequisites, the assignments should cover material that has been introduced in lectures. Non-introductory and advanced courses in R can require students to look outside of lectures for completing relatively complex problems.",162
"BEWARE. If you are someone who is new to more advanced math or to any sort of coding, this course will be very confusing, totally unpractical, and you'll walk away not feeling like you've really learned how to use R in a real way.I was incredibly disappointed.",162
"The lectures are good for basic understanding, but there are no sample programs in order to understand their real world application. And the assignments are not at all for beginners. There is a huge gap between the content and the assignments.",162
"To be honest, this is the most terrible course that I have ever had on Coursera. The courses are not well organized, and the assignment has little to do with the videos, which means students have to learn by themselves to finish the assignment",162
"Poorly organized and managed. Each week of this course should have been broken down into individual 4 week courses. I have 20 years software development experience, and I can tell you this is too much information to cram into a single class.",162
The new platform Sucks!!!The people who just want to learn for free and not purchase a certificate are barred from attempting the quizzes unlike the old platform. Not being able to take the quizzes completely ruins the learning experience. ,162
"You don't have to go through the videos which I found painful because of the instructor's voice. The textbook includes everything in the videos. However, there was no application for the videos and textbook in the quizzes and assignments. ",162
"I really wanted to learn R in my current Mac iOS environment, in a Linux/Unix environment.  I only see here the course offered in Windows environment in archaic MS-DOS environment?  I am not interested in that.  Hence I unenrolled.",162
Somewhere during the second week there is a gap in coding that I could not overcome and this ruined the whole interest in pursuing the course because in order to overcome it I had to cheat. I don't feel like I am learning anymore. ,162
This class is a travesty in learning R. The lessons are misguided and do not prepare you for the overwhelmingly difficult homework assignments needed to complete the course. I would not recommend this to anyone trying to learn R. ,162
"The topic which was discussed by the professor can't match with the assignments and quiz.I think the video of teaching should add more elements of practice, so that it would fit people with no basic knowledge of programming more.",162
"There is a significant gap between the lectures and assignments. For someone with very limited programming background, this posed a great hindrance to my ability to use the resources provided to be successful on the assignments.",162
"Possibly the least well structured class ever.  Also, not made for people to actually learn how to program in R.  It is sad that I paid for this, and ended up going to another resource to learn... and it was much much easier.",162
"Not a class for the beginning programmer.  The lectures do not line up with the assignments, and if you don't have programming experience, you could easily spend 10-20 hours/week figuring out how to finish the assignments.",162
"The ask in the fist assignment was not formulated correctly.  Felt the class needed more hands on learning.  Although the lectures were clear and concise, going back to them really didn't help me with the assignments.",162
I think there is a total mis-match between the lesson material and the assignments.  The amount of hours one needs to search the internet to augment the training.  The recommended text doesn't even come close in ,162
The assignments had nothing to do with the lectures. The teachers do a poor job of explaining basic concepts and theories. The class is a lot more advanced than the class description makes it seem.,162
"The assignments are too hard for the lessons that we had it made me frustrating, after week 2 I completely lost and didn't know what should I do .I really don't recommend this course for beginners",162
This course is the worst course that I have taken so far. I am not happy with the course content and the way that the lecturer uses to teach this course. I really want to refund my money!,162
There is a wide gap between the lectures and the practice. Its clear that the video material is completely inadequate and insufficient for the course. A poor introduction to programming.,162
"The jump from the lecture material to the assignments was way too much. In order to complete the assignments, one needs to spend lots of time learning things not covered in the course.",162
The course content does not match the material you are tested on in the assignments and quizzes. DO NOT take this course if you are looking for an introductory level coding course. ,162
Assignments don't match the lectures at all. Lectures are dry and simple and don't help you understand how to apply the topic to a real life situation. Don't waste your money.,162
Week 2 is an unreasonably difficult jump from Week 1. This course's beginner friendly lectures do not align with the level of understanding needed to complete the assignments. ,162
This course was labelled as for beginners but was in no way for beginners. The instructors were completely absent. The course material did not reflect the assignments at all.,162
Very hard for a beginner. Lacks the slow build up I needed. Missing an explanation about a comma cost me about 4 hours. The assignments are brutal which encourages cheating.,162
homework was poorly structured and not adequately discussed in the lecture videos.  Had to dig through several buried links to make any progress on the homework assignments.  ,162
"The assignments used knowledge WAY above that taught in both Swirl and the lectures, i managed to complete through a lot of research but this has been incredibly tough!",162
The level of assignments does not match the level of the course. They are very hard on a beginner. Some practice in the right direction could do help the beginner.,162
"It's too time consuming, not for a newbie. The classes are pointless, cause they are pretty easy and then the homework is ULTRA-DIFFICULT, classes are pointless. ",162
no help no teacher....it seems we are not here to learn but only to pay and challenged!! very very disapointing for a course that it sells for begninner!!,162
No se pone absoluto interesés en la progresión del alumno. Las explicaciones son extremadamente escuetas y las tares de una dificultad desproporcionada.,162
R training and coding is not good. Explanation is good but assignments are very different and one needs to self learn a lot of R coding by themselves.,162
"the worst course for someone has no knowledge about programming, if you don't have experience in any programming language .. don't take that course  ",162
"Lecturer is very poor, explains very little and the assignments he give have no connection whatsoever to what was taught. waste of money and energy",162
This is the 6 th course I have taken and two of the courses had serious problems with grading weekly exams. I need attention for this issue.,162
Assignments were too difficult and totally not relevant to learning materials. I believe alot of work needs to be input on course structure. ,162
insufficient study materials that dont cover quizzes and assignments content. had to give up after week 2.do NOT recommend for beginners.,162
course need to be better organised. more information should be taught in videos. more explanation should be given prior to assignments ,162

"Very poor ,frustrating and so so tough assignments in respective of the knowlegde they give you in video lectures or swirl exercises.",162
Lectures are very boring and designed in a weird way. He is simply reading the book that he wrote and no real practice was ever done. ,162
Not the best course for beginners. Too much theory and no implementation. Also the assignments were impossible for a beginner.,162

This course presumes you are a programmer to begin with. I tried to take the class to learn how to program. ,162
Assignments do not match up well with the lessons and the lessons are BAD. They are not educational.,162

"This course has more holes than swiss cheese. The instructor makes major leaps without thoroughly explaining things. A lot of times when I started to do a problem set it felt like I had missed 2 or 3 lectures. But I had not, the instructor just leaves you to figure a lot out on your own. The videos are choppy often containing errors that sometimes have a note stating the accurate information. The excel sheets are posted at the end of the lecture as opposed to the beginning. But they have nothing to do with the lectures other than the calculus behind the formulas. So you have to go through cell by cell to figure out what the hell the instructor did and what calculus was being used. I appreciate how the instructor combined a lot of material here but unless you are fresh of calculus 3 or several statistics class then this is complexly crap course. ",367
"Horrible instruction. Little to no motivation is supplied for each topic. Moreover, the statistical concepts taught in this course are not preceded by preliminary concepts. For instance, I believe it is not until the course is almost over that the concept of a random variable is discussed. Do not waste your time with this course if your goal is to be more skilled in excel.",367
"By far the most upsetting educational experience I have ever had.  This course has cemented my belief that good teaching ability is as rare among teachers as it is in the general population.  No care or attention was placed in how to sequence the information, as it is presented almost as a stream-of-consciousness on the topics of statistics.  There is absolutely NO substantive material in this course regarding data analysis within Excel.  The only interaction with Excel you will have is playing with atrociously designed pre-made spreadsheets - only used to plug in numbers into cells.  The course should be titled ""A confusing and meandering review of statistical concepts"", to at least avoid the embarrassment of claiming this course is on Excel - or that it will teach you anything.  I strongly recommend that this portion of the course be dramatically improved or entirely removed if the instructor and Coursera have any value for their reputation or a clear conscience.   ",367
"This course has nothing to do with Excel. It should be called ""Statistic and binary modelling with little use in excel"". If you except to learn about functions, pivot tabels, macros and the many other exciting features of excel, this is NOT the course for you. ",367
"I write all this with a constructive approach to improve the course and not harm this great university and its brand.The explanation and the videos do not correspond to the final project and or quices. Among other things, the creation of a mathematical model is requested and nowhere is it explained how to do it. The videos and the contents are messy, the esthetics of the videos are not very careful and messy. Isolated topics are explained without relating them to each other. Because of the disorder, large thematic voids are left, which are unsuccessfully attempted to fill in superfluous and rapid explanations incorrectly inserted in the quices and final projects.",367
The video just explains the basics but they dont take up detailed examples which are asked in the quizes and then it becomes very difficult to understand the concept,367
Misleading course name/title. Was expecting a course on using Excel. Forums were cluttered and not monitored often.,367
Sheet is hard and too high complex for understand.,367
Not for beginners as promised. You need strong statistical skills to understand it.,367
"Course is not what it say it will be, 10 % out of all exel learning where teacher not mentioning that he is using Microsoft on apple and do not explain anything for windows users. 90 % of the course is statistics and high algebra. Name of the course should be (statistics and algebra as main focus) and exel just as support",367
"Unfortunately, the material and lectures of this course fell short of my expectations. Lectures don't follow a logical path and are all over the place, and some concepts are not expanded as required. Overall, I believe they need to improve how the content is presented, and how it's applied in a real world context. ",367
"Lots of calculation scribbled on black board, course material inconsistently named, structure difficult to asses, unclear which material to use for final test; reviewing peers: difficult to see, where question ends and answer starts",367
"No relevance to specialisation. Do not expect to get through this if you have not taken multiple statistics courses at university level or higher maths. Barely any practical application, does not prepare you for final project. ",367
I would not recommend this course to any one. The things they teach in videos and questions they ask on test are pretty different. First few things are fine then the course turns the other way,367
Try to explain all statistics knowledge to beginners but all are not in-depth enough which even more confusing!  ,367
"Very poor lecture, I barely learn anything about excel from this course. The course title is quite mis-leading",367
"This course needs better explanations, there is a lack of details and you get lost easily.",367
This was more a statistics course than a,367
course is not related to the title,367
The class could be better,367
Sad.,367
"Probably the worst class I have ever taken on Coursera. The teacher asked us to do tons of things without explaining how and used tons of complicated math formulas without explaining what they were, what they did, or when and how to use them. There were also actual incorrect answers in the videos on occasion, so that even if you did do things correctly, you would think you were wrong and be confused, and there were a lot of inconsistencies between the spreadsheets used in the videos and the methods used to solve things compared to the actual spreadsheets given to us, which makes things pretty impossible to learn. If you're more advanced, it may be easier to find and understand the differences between the video and the spreadsheets, but the whole point of this class is that it is for beginners.",367
"Warning: The lecture videos along will NOT be enough to prepare you for the final assignment! Be prepared to do your own research for the extra study materials. On the forum, many students said they had to drop out during the last week (probably without getting a refund!) because they were completely caught off guard by the huge knowledge gap between lectures and the final assignment. If you are determined to get the specialization certificate, you should definitely start the final assignment as early as possible. Don't wait until the last week or two!! ",367
"Completely disorganised. You will be tested on material BEFORE you take the lesson teaching it, making you question your ability. The outline they provide for the order you should take the materials is completely wrong. If you want to learn by a guy scribbling quickly and messily with little in depth explanation about the concepts he teaches, go ahead and take this. Otherwise, avoid at all costs. Also, you learn nothing about using excel to perform data analysis, just given templates with no explanation on how they work.",367
"There is no Excel here but a lot of  theoretical and statistical topics that really make the lessons impossible to be understood if you don't have the appropriate background. At a certain stage, if you want to continue, you need to spend a lot of time to catch up trying to find on line what the trainer is talking about. It is a pity because I used Coursera already and I was happy with their courses, but not in this case",367
"If I could give it less than 1 star, I would.  It wasn't an Excel class, rather it was a targeted business statistics class with only disjointed lectures and no benefit of textbook to actually help you learn.  Lots of errors in the lectures and tests, and little to no support from course staff.  Stay away!  You won't regret it.",367
"I aced the first two weeks. It was recommended that I finish the first quiz of the final module. The information from the first two weeks would be fresh in my mind. I attempted the quiz, and encountered problems I was in no way prepared for.",367
I am pretty sure that there are a lot of people who have problems with this course. There should be more information and teaching for Test. It's hard to utilize the things we learn from video for test... ,367
"When the instructor for the course expresses amazement at the level of difficulty people are expressing in the forums that tells you a lot about how out of touch he is with what he is teaching and what is really required prerequisite knowledge.
There is minimal actual instruction in excel-most often concepts are 
taught much like Khan Academy, on a digital blackboard. Nothing 
inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 
'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually 
demonstrate using excel. Nope, not here.

If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course. Honestly. While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course. I've used Excel for over 15 years, daily, and to have the gall to say your course will 'master' something with a few videos is misleading and deceptive. If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure. If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs.  The course in more on the level of a 201 and in certain parts 401 level but not 101.",367
"I´m quite disappointed in this course. First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter. As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one. First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view. It´s BARELY READABLE ! It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed. That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time. The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere. The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio. It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review. I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples. With some changes that course will fly high :)",367
"The concepts here are useful and Mr. Egger is a knowledgeable instructor but 1) this class is really about gathering information with Excel as the tool - you aren't learning anything about Excel functionality, so the title of this course is really misleading if you just want to become a stronger user in Excel 2) there is a huge disconnect between the video lessons and the excel worksheets used to complete the assignments and since many previous reviewers mentioned this, it seems like that's not going to change. 3) the disconnect between the lessons and the assignments wouldn't be an issue if the instructor could be bothered to respond to forum questions. Mine sat unanswered for 5 days as the deadline passed. You are NOT going to get support if you dont understand something.",367
"Not done with the course yet, but I have to say it started out very well and organized. I was actually learning how to use excel in the first week WHILE the instructor was teaching. The later weeks, however, seem to be completely different. They're disorganized and I'm struggling to see how the material correlates. It's as if I'm being bombarded with random topics, in addition to the fact that the instructor literally stops using excel to teach. After week 1, lessons are just random notes on a blackboard with a link at the end to the excel sheet in which the instructor has already prepared before with A LOT of info that you need familiarize yourself with solo. I had high hopes when I was done with the first week, but now I have to say I'm bored and demotivated!! (so far)",367
"Irrationally difficult and inexplicably sloppy. Having taken first ""Business Metrics for Data Driven Companies"" I had high hopes that it would be on the same level. Well, I was wrong. It was extremely messy, jumping around from definition to definition with little to no explanation and there was a general lack of motivation from professor Egger's part.Apart from week 1 that had some necessary basic knowledge of Excel, all of the next weeks' lessons were fast paced beyond a beginner's comprehension. By week 5 I had lost the motivation to go on and was only able to finish it through a great deal of trial and error on the quizzesI would not recommend it, unless you have some basic knowledge of the economic theories used in this lesson.",367
"Complex concepts (e.g., regression), which cannot be taught in such a short course format (I know from extensive prior training), are taught here in an arcane way. I don't know how students without prior knowledge on these topics (e.g., regression, ROC curve analysis) could possibly understand this when taught this way. Course is also in an 'early draft' mode, with plenty of mistakes in the videos/slides. The course (and specialization) really tarnishes - instead of enhancing - this institution's outside image and reputation. Really a deception; sorry I took this class and specialization, a complete waste of my time and money. The initial presentation was misleading (and I have found online many people sharing the same feeling).",367
"Don't be fooled by how detailed and clear the first weeks videos are. The second thru the final weeks are lacking details and explanations and found myself lost during most of the videos. There were even a few typos and errors. Be ready to do a lot independent research and learning from other sources in order to complete the weekly quiz. I was unable to complete the final project of this course due to the lack of knowledge provided by the lecture videos and some of own research. I was hoping to complete the specialization for this, but it doesn't seem like this course provided me with enough to proceed.** The use of excel on the weekly basis was poorly integrated with the flow of the course. ",367
"Concepts are fantastic but the material developed to deliver the course is short of expectations, especially from a university. Excel sheets do not match what is demonstrated in video lectures, lots of confusion around how to complete tasks, quiz answer options not being correct, and missing Excel spreadsheets (e.g. video lecture says to refer to accompanying excel spreadsheet, but no spreadsheet available). Also, judging from past discussions by students, some inconsistencies around formulas being presented in video lectures versus assignment questions. could have been a great course, but the inconsistencies have made is very disappointing. ",367
"The title is very misleading. Excel is an afterthought for this course; instead there is a heavy focus on statistics. The class claims to be for beginners, but that is clearly not the case, as it requires previous knowledge in inferential statistics and calculus.Excel is hardly used and is certainly not the focus; there are weeks where Excel is not used at all. There are no practice assignments, only quizzes.It's clear that this course is outdated and poorly maintained, as the videos refer to examples that are not included or content that was not presented.Needless to say, I will not be taking any other courses in this specialization.",367
"I found the title of the course to be extremely misleading as it turned out to be more of a statistics course. This quizzes and assignments were extremely unfulfilling. Students were given prepared spreadsheets and are tasked to use them to answer questions. It was extremely tedious and messy to have to open many documents for one quiz. Furthermore, there was very little instruction of how to use the spreadsheets. I believe that this course would have had much more practical value if it guided students through the commands, and taught us how to create spreadsheets for data analysis.",367
"Firstly, this is not a course, it is a challenge. The instructor obviously has a solid mathematical background, but he lacks a lot of teaching skills and the ability to convey what goes on in his head, from where numbers and concepts come out. The material in Excel is not explained, it demands that the student unravel the relationships by auditing the worksheets.A complex content as such should be approached with extreme didactics and with several real examples, which facilitate the understanding of someone unfamiliar with the subject.At least I'm glad I did not buy the course.  ",367
"Says it's a class for people with no experience in statistics or calculus, but it's not true!  Use of spreadsheets in the course is poorly explained, examples are not relevant to the spreadsheet you're told to use ; and the material is covered way too quickly.  Excel functions are not properly explained and neither is the Solver plug in.  Of course you don't know this if you've prepaid for a specialization and are well past the two week refund period.  If you do make the mistake of taking this course - CHECK OUT THE FORUMS.  They are the only and best help you will get!",367
It is fraud! It is nothing relate to excel! It is about statistics advance. For people like me have no statistic background please don't try this course at all. You will have a miserable time. The only reason I still try to finish this course it to get bad comments for it! Run away from it! The teacher is so bad at teaching. Boring and geeky style. Can people please realize geeky does not mean a good teaching? I hate this course so much! I feel I watch the video again and again but get zero outcome. I just wish I can give it bad comments everyday.l,367
"Really wanted to take this class.  Unfortunately, I believe it is more about advanced statistics then excel.  It was advertised as a beginners class and that is not the case.  I recommend having a significant knowledge of statistics before taking this course.  I'm a 15 year senior level accounting executive and I was easily spending 10 to 15 hours a week plus watching the videos 3 or 4 times each in order to understand the content. It was very difficult to understand.  Disappointing.",367
"Material given is not enough for the graded quizzes questions. It would de very useful to have a guide with exercises solved with different complexities. Also, I passed various quizzes and I feel that if I face a real-life problem, I wouldn't know how to solve it, and I've seen other people writing the same in forums. Mentors hints given in week 4, are not about the actual questions of the graded quiz, and the last week I posted a question that actually hasn't been answered.",367
I dislike this course because I have to complete so many assignment in one week. Instructions could have improved and slides could have improved rather than using chalkboard. Sorry there are a number of times I have to rewatch the videos and still dont understand. Hence I even have to place myself in another slot because I could not finish the assignment. Please improve on this module so that it is more enjoyable for learners who really want to learn. Thank you. ,367
What a mess of a course! It looks like different parts of the course were re-ordered and as a result references to exam are incorrect.Much of the content on video doesn't match the exercises and terminology in one might not be used in the other. It's an awful course. I tried the exam and it makes close to no sense. Decided to cancel coursera subscription as a result of taking two courses of poor quality in this specialization. Life is too short.,367
"Muy decepcionado en la baja calidad del material entregado. Sin duda el profesor tiene un excelente manejo del tema, pero los recursos educativos utilizados son muy pobres. Muchos errores en los videos y en los cuestionarios.Las lecciones pudieron ser mucho mas claras y fluidas usando un simple ppt, pero el uso de la tableta de dibujo de tan mala manera, hace confusas las explicaciones y poco pulcras.",367
"An absolutely dreadful course. The only things you'll end up studying are how to use the spreadsheets given and what the instructor was thinking when creating them... I can't figure out what, and there doesn't seem to be any way of finding out. The lectures were mostly stuff I learned at school and really quite easy, but I just have no idea what the final project has got to do with the lectures.",367
"this course is definitely NOT for beginners. you MUST have intermediate to advanced knowledge of statistics and math. I had to resort to google and khan academy extensively just to grasp the concepts in this course. This course also does not teach you everything about excel, let alone master it.  you just refer to pre made excel sheets for quizzes. thats it. Good luck figuring those out.",367
"This course has nothing to do with data analysis in excel, but rather the mathematical concepts behind analysis in general. The only thing related to excel are the spreadsheets provided with the videos. Unfortunately, the professor never uses the spreadsheets and actually shows how to build said analysis, but rather just hands them to you and lets you figure it out with 0 guidance.",367
"This is an advanced Statistics class. Learning was chaotic, confusing, and fast paced. Strong Mathematics skills required. As icing on the cake, there is an 8 hour project at the end of the course .. and they only tell you at the end that you should have been working on this all along!  Not at all what I wanted to learn or find productive in the real world. ",367
I did not like the course at all. The first week was fine but then the course only offers pre-made excel sheets where we just have to change values and pass tests. The teaching videos every week are for less than 30 minutes total and there are 2 tests for 30 mins each. How is it even fair? It is really a pain. I am sorry but I am highly disappointed. ,367
"Was very frustrated with this course. Does not have a strong emphasis on Excel skills and the statistics models provided seem to be randomly chosen and poorly explained. Quizzes were interesting, but time-consuming because of the necessary extra research outside of provided lectures. ",367
"I don't even want to give 1 star even. The videos do not match the quizes at all. You have to put in much much more time on the useless sheets it provided, and they call it as practical experience! It's probably the worst course I've encountered on Coursera. Don't enroll it. ",367
"Content is not well organized, videos are disconnected from one
another, explanations are not clear, spreadsheets contain vast information
that is not explained anywhere. It is been quite difficult to follow through
the course and I bet many students are giving up.",367
"Being honest, the lessons in the course are disconnected with the weekly tests, specially for the final exam. Professor Daniel Egger and his assistan MUST improve the lessons, including examples step by step specially for the multiple linear regression su",367
"Not very helpful for those with a solid statistical background. I prefer to use R to do the modeling things, while this course should talk more about pivot tables and existing useful financial functions which advantage over other statistical tools.",367
Really unhappy with how difficult and over complicated it is. I came here to learn about Excel. Pivot tables? functions? The course really loses focus and its unfortunate that I am now stuck here and cannot continue the entire specialization. ,367
I can't even convey my frustration. Terrible course with a terrible teacher and misleading name. At the end of the course you don't learn any practical skills in Excel. Just avoid this course if you looking for practical knowledge,367
"Very confusing lectures, he says you don´t have to have a basic level of excel to do the course but I didn´t find that true. Struggled through all of the lecture videos and the quizzes seemed to come out of left field.",367
"No concept was shown in Excel, it was just like paper and pen, the traditional one. And the professor was eating half of the words in between. Please explain all the concepts using excel. this course is a total waste.",367
In the course info this is described as the first course in the series and that it requires no prior knowledge but the first week quiz contains questions referring to an equation 'discussed in the previous course'.,367
"Given this is the third (or fourth) iteration of this course, it's telling that the errors from the original release remain in the videos and quizzes.  There are other, higher-quality Data Science MOOCs available.",367
The Audio is not audible properly and the course material is not explanatory. The content and the quizzes or tasks dont add up. I had to often refer to google to find the modeling ideas.,367
The course structure is not thoughtfully prepared. There is a lot of confusion around what the instructor wants to say. The practice quizzes and course content have no match whatsoever,367
"Don't know how to apply the statistics and excel formula in real world situation. Besides, it becomes focus on approving statistics equation than teaching data analysis in excel",367
En mi opinion es un tema muy interesante sin embargo cuesta entender lo que el profesor está diciendo por lo que es muy dificil llevar el ritmo del material...,367
"Poorly coordinated lectures. References to resources that are not provided. No response (at least, for days on end) when questions are posted on the forums",367
"Interesting statistical concepts, and great theory. However, the lectures and the quizzes do not prepare the student well for the final project.",367
Not a well structured course at all.  There is not much clear explanation on the subjects. You pretty much need to figure it out by yourself.,367
"Terrible course, almost no focus on Excel and the lectures were incomprehensible. Please redo this class with Dr. Borg teaching it.",367
Where is the course study material and are you providing a book on this subject and Excel? You have me lost.,367
"Really bad course, teaches stuff which are very basic and then the tests are really nothing based on that",367
absolutely one of the worst courses... I am deleting it from my list. no slides make it harder to follow. ,367
"the course neither explains statistics properly, nor teaches how to use excel effectively, disappointed",367
This is more of an introduction to statistics lesson than one in excel... not what I had signed up for,367

"This course does not include real-world examples as compared with other 2 courses in the series. The other lecturers energy was quite obvious and the lecturer in this course does nothing extra. This is the traditional teaching method where we should keep on grasping theory without understanding applications.While I have learned many new concepts, I am 100% unsure I have not understood the course in general.The assignments in the course was poorly constructed and the lectures did not explain anything more about numpy methods.I will not recommend this course to anyone.",612

Very poorly written/performed material with inadequate coding help. The engagement level is quite low. Will not recommend if you have novice programming background or new to math concepts.,612
"Worth auditing because the video lessons are good but unless you have solid Python programming experience, the assignments and some quiz questions will take you days instead of hours. The course info states that you would need 'Basic knowledge in python programming and numpy'. This is to be understood as 'solid practice, at least intermediate level'. 'Basic knowledge' simply does not make it possible to finish these exercises within the given timeframe (1-2 or even 3-4 hours).  As many others, despite having no problem with the maths, I gave up during week 1 because of this issue and of not having this amount of free time while already working full time. This should be emphasised in the course description, apart from the extra mathematical creativity that already appears there. And it should also appear in the description of the whole specialisation, which states that programming experience 'comes in handy but is not necessary'. Many people who start doing the courses are determined to finish the whole specialisation. ",612
This course needs a lot of work to get to the level of quality of its two predecessors. ,612
"The instruction is absolutely bad and not worth it. However, if you have patience to re-watch, refer to other supporting materials, learn on your own a  lot and then have patience to deal with programming asssignments ,...then you might find the final result useful. ",612
Way too hard compared to the other courses in the specialization. I feel like I wasted my money on this. ,612
Loved the first two courses but felt like killing myself in this course. One of the worst professors i have ever encountered. ,612
"This course is awful. The videos have no useful explanations, the speaker seems to be reading some slides. The provided material is really bad; there are even links to wikipedia! The difficulty level of the assignments is beyond the one proposed by the lessons. The programming tasks consist only on reproducing formulas; most of the time you are struggling with numpy implementation issues. In summary: stay away from this course.",612
Frustrating. Videos and material does not cover what it is asked for in the quizzes and assignments.,612
Explanation of course material is not clear,612
"I passed the course with good grades, I like an idea of such course. But my opinion is: the course needs substantial improvement. Period. I personally enjoyed listening to Marc Peter - he's an excellent lecturer and super-smart guy. His book on math for Machine Learning is challenging, but almost perfect. But the course itself is a disappointment. 1) Precious lecturer's time is _wasted_ on explaining very basic concepts such as mean and variance... to make the course accessible for poor gals/guys with no math in head at all and, consequently, to enable Coursera to earn more $$. But it doesn't help - what they'll do in Week 4 once eigenvectors with show up from nowhere?? Unfortunately the course is not for them2) Lecturer wastes his _super precious_ time by multiplying matrices by hand. Screw it. I'm also lecturer at university and from my experience such demo should be done once/twice. And after that, guys, matrix operations in numpy have to be demonstrated in the class, otherwise practical exercises could be done only by those with solid prior experience in Python + NumPy3) Quality of practical assignments is below any critics. Some cannot work at Coursera platform, they should be run locally and to run Jupiter Notebook locally one has to be seasoned Python programmer and good DevOps. Guidelines to practical assignments do not guide at all. SW practices in assignments are dubious.Bottom line: kindly advice to develop two courses - overview for those without linear algebra  knowledge at all, and normal one - focused on Week 4 material. Coursera format with 5 minute lectures cannot accommodate such course? Leave this platform, Marc Peter is great lecturer and specialist, his name should not be associated with such failure.Regards,   Akiva     ",612
"I have already completed this course but i felt like i needed to share my frustration regarding this 3rd course of the specialization. First of all, the previous two courses were excellent! I am not judging based on difficulty, those two courses opened my eyes on linear algebra and calculus. But this 'PCA' one is utterly disappointing. It revisited some theories of the previous courses in such a bad way.If most of the things need to be learnt through the reading materials then is it justified to do this course? I mean I can find even better reading materials on the web. The only reason i kept on going is to go through the PCA portion of week 4. All topics of previous weeks were already covered by me that's why i didn't have to struggle much. But the explanations were quite inadequate and proofs of the theorems felt like rushed. I somehow managed to reach the final assignment and then my real frustration began. The grader was giving inappropriate results, submitting my code gave me 2/3 out of 10. after resubmitting with the same code multiple times, I finally passed the assignment. Won't recommend this course to anyone. ",612
"The lecturer doesn't provide us with adequate information to connect all materials together. Much knowledge in lectures are not enough or unrelated to completing programming homework or tests. In one of the programming assignment, the guidance is misleading and I believe most of us reached out for help in forum to finish the assignment. In week one, everything looks pretty simple but the question and lectures are kind of unclear. Everything then goes worse in week two. the programming assignment is a nightmare. If you are familiar with python, you may only spend hours to complete this. Otherwiese you may have to struggle between unclear guidance, bugs and python syntax. Week three is not so bad but a lot of resource are from wikipedia with little illustration. Week four is jammed with auxiliary materials and massive critical PCA knowledge with limited explanation. I simply feel I was fooled to enroll in this course.",612
"After the first two courses in the specialisation, this one was truly disappointing. You are warned at the beginning that this course is challenging. This is true, but there is absolutely no reason why it should be THIS challenging. There are several factors that make this course more difficult than it needs to be. The poor pacing leads to a bizarre mix of repetitive trivial questions and vague assignments with poor explanation and over-reliance on reading external sources. Nobody wants constant hand-holding but the lack of direction will lead to you wasting far too much time chasing down minor technical errors and figuring out what on earth is being asked of you. Finishing this course was a slog and I just wanted to wash my hands of it. The first two courses in this specialisation are great and I highly recommend them, but I would not be happy if I had paid £38 for this course.  ",612
"I really loved the first two courses in the specialisation, but this one honestly is a disaster. This is bad teaching at its finest: ""I'll throw a bunch of formulas at you and it is your job to figure out what they mean"", ""Here is an important concept that is critical to understanding the material, but I don't have time to cover it so please check it out Wikipedia instead"".The lecturer shows no passion to the subject whatsoever and spends all the time writing out monstrous formal definitions instead of trying to build student's intuition of what things really mean. This is exactly what Sam and David were so good at in the first two courses, and it is a real shame they had to replace them for this final course.As others pointed out programming assignments are indeed poorly constructed, with lots of pitfalls and generally speaking very frustrating.",612
"After taking/passing the two previous courses, this course is very disappointing. The programming assignments are more about numpy/python peculiarities (which dimension is D or N) and deciphering cryptographic specifications (X is documented as an input but not a parameter to the function). The misleading templates appear to be intentional - it is not clear what educational purpose this serves. The difficulty in this course is not conceptual understanding - it is difficult because the assignments are intentionally confusing. Another point regarding programming in general. This course prefers implementing numerous functions (no testing), generating large amounts of random data as input, and assuming all goes well. Perhaps each function should be tested for correctness individually with known input/output - this is not a novel idea.",612
"I did the 3 specialization lessons ""Mathematics for Machine Learning"" (Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, PCA). I really had a lot of fun and learnings in the first one (5 stars for Linear Algebra): David Dye is an increadible teacher. The second one is okay (3 stars for me). In the third one (PCA) the expected knowledge difference between the lessons (easy to follow) and the programming tasks of weeks 2 and 4 was to high and to much challenging for me. I had no fun to pass the corresponding tests and I have finished the lessons with the only one target to be done. It doesn't correspond to what I'm looking for when I'm learning during my week-end.",612
"This was a terrible course in every way possible. DO NOT waste your time and money on it. The lecturer skips over things way too fast and delivers poor explanations, and then gives ridiculously hard programming assignments when this course is supposed to be mainly about maths. Moreover, he asks quiz questions about topics he doesn't even cover in the lectures, and the answers provided are terrible. Very poor quality course, which is a shame, because the other two courses in this specialization are actually worth doing. ",612
I've finished all the two previous courses in this specialization.I was shocked at seeing the content and programming assignments given to us.It was totally different.They expect a lot from us.Content is not up to the mark.First two courses was awesome.But this course is an exact opposite to the first two.Totally disappointed!! I was hoping to finish this specialization.But it seems I cannot. I didn't expect this.,612
Concepts weren't taught well and programming exercises are full of errors. Very difficult to debug and find out if I am on track during the programming exercises. Lecturer lacks passion and ability to convey core concepts well to audience. Hard to follow up on the mathematical derivation with the simple stuff that we were taught in module 1 and 2.,612
"Too few examples given during the lessons. More examples could greatly improve understanding and the solution of quizzes and programming assignment.I had to integrate this course with multiple sources I looked up for by myself, so I'm really wondering if I wisely spent my money on this course.",612
Instructor writes down equations and formal definitions while reading out loud what he is writing. None further explanations are given.Basically whole course is a voiced list of equations together with some links to Wikipedia which even further empathize pathetic quality of content.,612
"The lectures are only partly related to the quizzes and assignments, some parts are just unnecessarily over complicated and confusing. The final and most important assignment is so computationally heavy so it's hardly running locally ",612
The lecturer was not always understandable.,612
"The first two courses in the specialization were extremely good. However, this course is nowhere close to them. Neither does the instructor provide enough intuition, nor do the assignments help in the learning process.",612
The first two courses of this specialisation were awesome PCA being a hard topic is difficult to understand but the course was boring and not good compared to previous two.,612
"Programming assignments' quality is too bad to follow it. Their lecture's explanation and assignments' notation are not matched. Moreover, the code is sometimes ridiculous. ",612
"The didactic value of this course is rather low. The lectures do not explain the very concepts required to sovle the subsequent assigments, or do it in a very poor way.",612
"Worst Course I have ever token on Coursera, the instructor hadn't mention any examples or simplify the information.",612
"Very tough course, the first 3 weeks are good, but the last week is as poorly explained as one can imagine",612
If I could give it negative stars I would.  ,612
topics are poorly explained and confusing,612
"Very Poor course on PCA, My recommendation. Don't watch it, Please don't waste your money on it.Reasons:1) The course on algebra and calculus was intuitive geometrically and well taught. Here the instructor bothered only doing derivations. No intuition based thinking, no analogy to real world. Just plain hard notations.2) I don't think even the instructor would understand what was taught in the course. The excercises were completely unrelated to what was taught. Not much given examples. The examples choosen uses values like 0,1,2. Why can't you pick some odd numbers to make it bit more non confusion and clear. 3) At the end there was a review /  Survey for every course. The review for this course is disabled. Clearly everyone knows how bad this is. Remove this course or make it better that is what the recommendation. There is no provision for zero stars, Had there one I would not given that also. Really frustrated with the PCA course. Please don't waste your time and money . Get Gilbert Strang's book. That will do justice for every penny. I was able to complete the course, All thanks to Gilbert's book on Linear Algebra. Thanks",612
"The technical issues with Jupyter Notebooks really made me waste too many days, a lot of my time not learning but just fighting a poorly implemented exercise.  And the technical issues did not help the teacher, the notebooks had a role to give us a place to learn new concepts that he mentioned in the fly, but there were no small sets of data to test the functions.  I wasn't very patient with the way he will say things like ""this is the formula from the previous video"", and show a different formula from what he had on the previous video. Really? Why making things obscure on purpose? You can just have said, we had our previous formula and them used properties of the transpose of a product to get this other formula. Please make an effort to redo the notebooks. Even better, do some of the examples in Phyton during class for what you do in paper, and then let us take those examples and make a general function on the notebooks. Give smaller databases, something easy to plot and test, without waiting 20+minutes to have a result.",612
"I started this course with lots of enthusiasm since the previous two courses were exceptionally well structured and helpful, but I can not compare this course with those two.The biggest problem for me was that Programming assignments are not well written and most of the time beyond the course material shared. It challenges your previous skills and may hit your self-confidence. There are also few mistakes or/and skipped steps in the video, and they make progress little tricky. My classmates were very helpful, and I would suggest relying more on the forums than video lectures when you need help. I would not recommend this course at all to anyone, but if you have done the first two, may complete the last one to complete the specialization. Also, the first two courses are a few of the best certificates that I did on Machine Learning, and I have done six other mathematics for machine learning, currently enrolled for a degree course in Data Science.All the best!",612
"The instructor is extremely dry and monosyllabic and does a very poor job of explaining topics, he frequently introduces topics by jumping straight into formulas without bothering to explain the topic or the use of the subject he is supposed to be explaining.The majority of lectures are no more that the lecturer reading our a formula parrot-fashion  onto the screen, he makes no effort to make the subject informative or explain what is going on. In many cases, he doesn't even bother creating a lecture, he simply posts a link to Wikipedia.Lectures, quizzes and assignments are littered with bugs and omissions.A negative mark on an otherwise excellent specialisation. This lecturer has no place teaching, he made the whole subject unapproachable.",612
"Do not take this course. This course is just a waste of time, money, and effort. The instructions in this course are vague and useless. You have to learn everything from the internet in order to answer the quiz. The programming assignments are so poorly designed that there is no difference between a blank notebook and programming assignments in this course. The grader will grade everything wrong even when your code is correct. You have to do extra maneuvers in order to get your assignment graded correctly. IF I HAD AN OPTION OF GIVING A NEGATIVE RATING I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS COURSE A MAXIMUM NEGATIVE RATING. EVEN 1 STAR RATING IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS COURSE.",612
The course has two problems:complete lack of participation of staff in maintaining it. This leads to students giving each other incorrect advice and sharing incorrect code which passes the grader function check ( the grades are assigned automatically). The advice students give each other are frankly so wrong it is shocking.the teacher focuses on formalised proof rather than concepts. Hence the lectures turn into lecturer applying mathematical transfomations which end in a formal argument without any intuitive understanding of the underlying subject. This course is the worst of the module with linear algebra and multivariate calculus being much better ,612
"Very disappointing compared to the other courses. Recommend a complete revision of the course materials. Quizzes often had nothing to do with the preceding video. I worked through a week two quiz using the extensive notes in the discussion forum and by searching the internet. The next lecture proceeded in the same vein: the instructor failed to cover the material in video leaving me to figure out what the material was and then figure out how to find that material on the internet or in reference books. At that point, it just was not worth the time to take the course.",612
"This course is far far far behind my expectations.The other two course in the specializition is fantastic. There is no visualization in this course, Instructor is always doing his algebra, concepts are poorly explained. I can't understand a lot of concepts in this course because of my poor math background.But why do i take ths course if i have a solid background in math? Programming assignments is not difficult but hard to complete because of vaguely clarification.Plenty of time wasted to find what should i do, its' really frustrating.",612
"This has to be one of most nightmarish, ugly, courses I have taken on the Coursera platform. Lousy, boring instructor, assignments that are so full of bugs that even the staff cannot resolve the issues. Add to that very low participation from the mentors and teaching staff in responding to student concerns and questions.Hey Marc, teaching staff and Imperial College. Get your act together!!IOW This course sucks big time! Take it at your own risk",612
"The course is very monotonic and boring and it is quite difficult to understand much of what the extremely mathematical terms that the instructor does. I am an M.Sc. Mathematics student and even I could not understand nor enjoy more than half of the course. I would strongly advise against taking this course, however the other two courses from this specialization are good and interesting.",612
"Feedback for the assignments sucks! The discussion forums don't help. I have to submit the last assignment last 6 times until it work, and I still don't know why my previous versions didn't pass. Other than that, the lectures are actually very good, but the only one worth the time is the fourth one, the other three are just the first course (Linear Algebra) all over again.",612
"Mathematical concepts are clear, but no explanation how to apply them to python to solve machine learning ussies. But you need this for python assignments.Scripts checking assignments work uncorrectly such a way that one can submit the same piece of working(!) code and get 0/10 and then submit the same code and get 10/10. All in all, it's very annoying and disappointing.",612
I was expecting to learn a lot in this course. I did not. The lectures don't really explain much at all and then you're thrown a quizzes and assignments that do not match what was in the actual lectures. The rest of the specialization was great but this course falls of the other two.The explanations in the videos are very poor. Really disappointed.,612
"The course is mathematics for Machine Learning. Yet, they require that you are proficient in python. I understand the mathematics. However, no one will answer my questions on the python we are suppose to code. I passed both of the previous courses. I've taken and passed Statistics with python on edX. I've very disappointed in this course.",612
Very sketchy presentation of complex material. Each lecture averaged around 5-6 minutes when they should have been 15-20 minutes. As a result the instructor glossed over the material without adequate explanations and derivations. And no one at Imperial College seems to be responding to recent posts in the discussion forums. ,612
There are no numerical examples as the course progresses. The instructor does everything algebraically. As a result I was not able appreciate the practical use of PCA. Later on I saw there are very nice videos in Youtube that illustrate the concept more lucidly using numerical examples.  I am disappointed.,612
"Marc Peter Deisenroth jumps too much at the important computation steps. Some steps might be simple to him, but it could be very misleading to students.Often times, he will just throw out some equations without letting the student know what exactly we are trying to achieve. ",612
Intentionally obtuse. No effort whatsoever is given to helping people learn. The instructors don't answer questions and they admittedly make their lectures hard to understand.I only took this because there were no other courses on available at the time.,612
"One of the worst online courses I have had. Inconsistent teaching, relaying on students having previous knowledge about Python and rads (where the heck did that come from?), failing to convey what and where this is practically used for. ",612
"PCA was my main interest in this specialization, and it felt very rushed and lazy (i.e. important explanations are fully missing, or just done via pdf from a book). I used *a lot* of Khan Academy to understand what's going on.",612
I would give ONE STAR because the instructor of this course was worst. He don't know the teaching and concepts too. He seems to be so low energetic instructor I have ever seen. A very bad experience after taking this course. ,612
I don't know if this course has been deliberately made hard to understand or I was lacking something. Lectures were pretty useless to me. Coding exercises were not clearly defined. I felt utterly frustrated at times.,612
You'll likely catch on pretty early that this course will mostly expects you to learn the content elsewhere. You're paying for mostly just for assignments and quizzes which there are far more of than video lectures.,612
The lectures gave incomplete information for the understanding of the material and the homework assignments. Wish this course was stretched to be a 10 week course so that we can all thoroughly learn the material.,612
"The lessons are not clear and if one wants to learn and understand what is going on with the math/algebra, has to study with other resources, because the videos of this course just throw up info´s on screen. ",612
" Definitely, not for beginners. Just as bad as the last one. They need to have more examples, which walk you through the ones like they give you on the homework as well as an example of how to do Python.  ",612
"There is hardly any co-relation between videos and assignments, while the lectures were at high school level but the assignments were at graduate level. It is high time to revise the course contents.",612
"By far the worst online course that I've ever done. Assignments require a lot of experience in Python, which is not communicated upfront. At the same time, staff doesn't provide any actual support.",612
You will spend most of your time lost.Quizes are not clear and ill-prepared.You will need to spend a lot of time looking for material outside of the course to actually make progress.,612
1. Not intuitive like first two programs2. The assignments sometimes jumped concepts and were not cohesive3. The in-lecture problems seemed rushed through,612
"This course is not like other two, which explain much clearly. When I do the practice quiz and coding, I resort to find other help on the Internet.  ",612
"This course is really bad and extremely hard to follow. Previous two courses were executed very well, teaching quality in this is poor.",612
Worst of the three courses. I learned much more on the internet because of the lack of examples or explanation. Just not worth it.,612
I did not register in this course to have some person read out the textbooks or dictate the derivations in the lecture videos. ,612
Too conceptual and theoretical making it difficult to understand. Examples would have helped a lot.,612
very very bad course! Assignments and quizzes made as shit. NO answers. Worth NOTHING! ,612
Previous Two Courses were better in terms of both assignments and teaching.,612
Very Poor when compared to previous two courses of this specialization.,612
This course was a disaster for me. The first two were great though.,612
Impossible to do without apparently an indepth knowledge of python.,612
Very poor teaching and overall it's the worst course I've taken,612
Very bad explanation. The assignments need more instructions.,612

"Course was good overall. I will not take the time to discuss in detail the information taught; it was delivered well and was valuable. However, after watching many many minutes of these videos, it became really redundant for the first 15 seconds of each video to be an animation reminding me of where I am in the course. This is redundant because it is obvious where you are in the course when you navigate to any video.. in any course. The website displays where you are. I do not feel I need to be reminded with 15-20 seconds of silent animations showing me where I am; I just want the video to start. Secondly, it was really frustrating to be failed on the final writing by my peers for the most heinous complaint. We were directed to describe how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich to someone who has never seen one before. Because this is all the information given, I have to assume the user has seen some sand-which; just not a peanut butter and jelly one. I do not feel I should have to teach someone how to open a bag of bread. It should be common knowledge that something has to be opened to get it out. I should not have to teach kitchen etiquette and cleanliness. One user who failed me commented that because I did not direct him to set the bread on to a clean plate... that he was confused; and could have mis understood to the point where he placed the sandwich on the floor. Another user said that I should have described how to hold the knife. He did not know if he should hold it by the sharp end, or the handle. One of those users marked me off for not being concise because it did not use bullet points or numbers and that he was expecting a recipe format. Look! I am not here to suppose a user came out of a cave. When you fail me for these types of issues using this logic; that same logic makes me think I should describe how to make a sandwich by growing your own wheat, making grain, baking bread, growing strawberries to make jelly, etc. But I did not go that far! No... I simply re wrote my project and upload to accommodate these 3 users by including that the bread should be opened, how to hold a a utensil, and I even included images of the sandwich so that the user could check their work as it is assembled to ensure the user could make a sandwich in 14 simple short sentence steps labeled accordingly. Well guess what?! My project was graded by another 3 users who complained that it is common sense how to hold a knife and remove bread from a bag and that I should have given them more credit for having some level of food assembly knowledge and I barely passed. I passed by 1 point. Yah, they almost failed me for being too lengthy. Honestly, I only added 3 or 4 short sentences compared to the original. Being graded by your peers gives too brought of feedback in cases like this. If the last 3 users would have graded by first paper, I would have passed. If the first set of users would have graded by second paper I would have passed. Lastly, I got an email upon completion of the first course that said my certificate was ready to print once I uploaded my photo ID (drivers license) along with a second photo of me for validation. Once I uploaded these 2 images; I got a notice that there was no certificate to be given for this particular course. I would not have shared my personal information with you at this point in time if I knew nothing would be available to print yet. That too was frustrating. ",4
"This felt like an honest waste of time. The course could have been completed in 2 days by my 8 year old daughter. I highly doubt any employer will take this certification seriously when they see it on a resume. In fact, I would not be surprised if an employer decided to NOT hire the applicant by seeing this on the persons resume. I literally did not learn a single thing from the entire course. The final exam was to write an essay on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. What in the honest F does that have to do with IT??? I really wish I did more research. I watched a YouTube video of a guy who applied to 300 jobs after receiving this certification and did not get a single callback aside to work at the mall as an Apple genius. Apple geniuses don't need ANY experience!!! To say I am disappointed is an understatement. I hope my review is not removed, the world deserves to know how much of a waste of time this course is. ",4

At least at the very introduction that's what you see! ;( Being involved with tech since the early '80s, I remember when Microsoft was in its peak as a giant tech company late 90s, then they started offering this ""Microsoft certification"" for tech professionals, it was something very respected in the market, very prestigious. If you had a Microsoft certificate during that time, a job related to tech was a sure thing. In their program, there wasn't ""sociology/anthropology/politics"" mixed with tech, it was all about tech. (period)",4
One of the worst courses I've tried.DO NOT PAY FOR THIS!!Google is using their reputation to make money. The speakers are just reading information from a teleprompter. They seem more interested in their tight t shirts and muscles than actually teaching. Not to mention the numerous mistakes they make while reading; one would think Google went to a gym and picked up a bunch of people to read some tech stuff someone wrote in 5 minutes.There has been no effort put in to make this course a learning experience and that is evident within the first week of material itself. The courses on udemy are a million times better (literally) with instructors who are passionate about teaching (Check out Mike Meyers on Udemy). Thankfully I enrolled in this course with the 7 day trial period. Out I go. I still feel cheated because I invested my time and effort into really learning because I trusted Google to put out good lessons. Then I went onto Udemy and saw what good lessons actually were.WHAT A SCAM!,4
"Your website is really TERRIBLE. I enjoyed this first part of the course. The instructors were great. I am on the second part of the course right now and navigating your website is just plain RIDICULOUS. When i signed on to resume my course, clicked my course, instead of taking me to where I logged off the last time time, it keeps bringing new ads to enroll. I am not on a free course program. I am on a paid course program. Until I am done with the course, you should not be bombarding me with new programs to enroll in. I have been signed on to coursera website trying to resume my studies for the past ten minutes. It still won't take me to where i logged off the last time . I tried my purchases, my course, my profile, all I am getting are adds to enroll in new programs.  You guys needs to fix this. I hate rating you guys a 1 for your website when the instructors and the presentations are great. But the frustrations I am getting from navigating your website, you deserve it. ",4
The process to receive your certificate and to verify your account does not work. I had to try to make it work 7 times. Every time I would talk to someone for help they would say that there was no record of the attempt being made. Its almost like they don't even care. They are saying what needs to be said but the problems are not being resolved. Yet I have 7 error messages on my phone telling that 7 attempts were made.  I am very unhappy with the services and I am telling as many people as I know about my bad experience in this certification class because nothing is being done to fix the problems.  I wish my college had picked a better company to get a certificate from than this one. You all are the worst.,4
Although this course is the first of many....im trying to figure out why the completed percentage keeps going down. Not to mention I completed this in August but its showing a date of the September 20. I completed my first course at a100% rate but yet it says that I'm at a 98.06. Not only that...but I purchases the second course after that one and cant even find my courses now. is this shit a scam or something? sorry for being so unprofessional but it is your sites and staff that is making this difficult. Hell... i cant even speak to you all if i wanted to but yet I'm doing all the work. Thanks for nothing. ,4
My most sincere review of this course is that it is not what I expected. I thought I was going to receive a more in depth training on the technical side of IT support. What was received were the bare bones basic level of computer knowledge that is taught in grade school along with basic customer service skills. It was what I would consider a waste of time and money. The coursework could have been completed in one or two days had it not been for the long videos. This course should have been advertised differently.,4
"I don't want rate this course because i see all the effort  because I see all the effort and affection with which it has been developed, but really this course is not for me, and the only reason why I am doing it is because I have no possibility of unsubscribing from it.They force me to rate the course with stars if I want to continue so I will give it one even though I know it is not what it deserves, but then they may begin to give themselves the opportunity not to force to put stars in order to continue",4
"I had worked hard to complete the course but they didn't give me the certificate it is sad. I have verified my account by giving it the student identity card of my current studentship in KUET,Bangladesh but they can't verify my account & stopped the verification of my ID as it has 5 attempts bt they didn't say before that verification code can't be acceptable after 5 attempts. Now instead of completing the full course properly, they can't give the certificate. I'm sad!!",4
"there is a broken ""This item will be unlocked when the session begins."" error message that pops up at the completion of every module that will not allow access to the final Quiz.Searched all over the website for a fix, the closest I could find was a reference to jumping forward to the end of the class.... and I did not do that.Discussion Forums patent reply was to contact Coursera to the 20+ similar information seeking posts.Can someone fix this? ",4
"Week 1 went well, however, I have been unable to take the final quiz  of week 2 (assemble a computer) because the instructions state that the areas are marked in red but they are all marked in blue and I cannot move forward.  Additionally, the instructions are confusing and there is no chat or tech support for my issue.  I would appreciate any help with this problem.",4
"Venia avanzando muy bien, pero la plataforma me borró los cursos realizados, tenia intención de completar todos los cursos, pero la deficiencia en la plataforma y como te borra o pierdes los avances le quita toda la seriedad. Desde mi parte, no creo volver a confiar en esta plataforma para validar o mejorar mi carrera profesional.",4
Tests are full of errors and the instructors never answer to our questions. Seems like something quickly banged up together in order to take more money but doesn't offer any in-depth information or any input from instructors of the course; students are pretty much left to struggle with both coursera and labs' issues on their own. ,4
I ended my susbscription in this course becauseI have always had problems with Linux VM and have tried to email or call  for technical but it looks like nobody is ever available to help.I would not recommended the coursera platform to anybody for learning purposes instead i would recommend udemy.com...,4
Please remove me from the IT course.  I did OK for the first three weeks but I have not been able to begin the quiklab to start the VM practice.  I have chatted with three individuals and spent several hours trying to get into the module.  I'm tired of trying.  Please do not charge me any more.  OK?,4
"Please help me how i resolve my varification id of my face its showing system camera not working,please resove my issue by giving my ADHAR CARD number,or dl no,pan card card numbers.or bank account details,plesae help me out to get this certificate,'Regards ASHUTOSH MAHARANA",4
The constant talk about how people should be hired based on their race is annoying. Alejandro coming in with his supposed sob story of his father being a mechanical engineer was pretty laughable. Makes it hard to value much of the teaching,4
This course is condescending an unhelpful to anyone with a functional understanding of computers and likely confusing and equally unhelpful to anyone without. There is no reason for anyone to ever take this course. It is a waste of time.,4
I Payed for the course completed the course with a good grde and verified my IDMy Completion certificate and shareable certificate is delayed.I will be reporting to google if my shareable Certificate and badge  is not issued shortly,4
I spent the last 2 days (atleast 4 hours each) creating windows folders and when I am done there is not grade or proof of completion being provided. I have read the instructions over and over again. What's the way forward for me???,4
It's been about a week and I have been unable to do any labs because of supposed issues. Very concerning when teaching Technical Support and there appears to be an inability to technically support the course itself.,4
"Watching videos of individuals talking about computer concepts is not conducive to my learning style.  Khan Academy or study dot com show illustrations along with the voice over, allowing for better retention.  ",4
"Half of material can be easily thrown away. 10 seconds of every video starting from useless animation of course structure,Also I'm not interested at all to know how presenters ended up in IT industry.",4
I got very little input from the representatives from Qwiklabs and I had to write to them instead of a one on one phone call which would have made it a lot to fix my issues. Very disappointed!!,4
"no real help line to ask question, I have finished all 6 weeks fundamental course within 3 days but do not know what next because I am very excited about going forward but how?",4
I completed the Technical Support Fundamentals event. I feel the contact of the event is excellent! but the lab have alot to be worked on! Customer Service could NOT even help!,4
"This course should be entirely optional, If you have ever setup a minecraft server you already know everything this course has to offer, also Google is evil as f*ck",4
To be true I could not stand the haphazard way this course is made and if you have a gmail account forget about doing week 3 assignments  they will not work.,4
Insufficient support of technical issues. Blame placed on 3rd-party apps. No solutions to extremely common issues. I will not be using coursera ever again. ,4
Doesn't continue to the next courses required to complete the program and doesn't inform the learners; that makes for a terrible terrible experience. ,4
"Wikipedia is NOT a reliable source.  Anyone can edit it at anytime.  Also, I do not feel the course content adequately teaches binary concepts.",4
I am not able to access the linux part of Labs section in both the weeks of the course can I get the alternate one forthis assignment.,4
Very Basic for students in class 6th or 7th not for College Students.Literally they teach what is computer and when it was created.,4
This is not what I thought it would be as I already have A+ and N+. I was hoping to be able to do GOOGLE support!How do I cancel?,4
it is soooooooo hard to remember everything . i wish there was some way to print everything i learned so i can go back to it ,4
The videos were so slow and they didn't explain anything about troubleshoting!!!         I wasted 49$ for nothing!!!,4
Very basic information and simplistic exercises and concepts. It lacks the depth of a professional certificate.,4
Why do I have to verify my ID for this course? Irritating. Most of the Question and answers are very biased,4
"It is very difficult to get guidance or help with any technical issues, such as problems downloading files. ",4
Waste of time to be honest! Terrible course. Awful truly awful! Can't believe google standing behind it!,4
Please disenrolled me. I wanted to cancel the course for now. Send me a link to where I can cancel it.,4
My course has been locked for three weeks and I can not get tech support to resolve the problem.,4
I have completed all levels. But I can't get certificate as my national ID is not verificated.,4
"Week 3 Labs are not registering as ""complete"".  QuikLabs doesn't seem to be updating Coursera.",4
Do not understand why Google wants money for this junk.  Good luck with the Qwiklabs loading.,4
I need more help to complete my assignments. A forum to ask questions and get more help.,4
" concepts are not explained fully, easy way of telling refer complimentary stuff. ",4
stop asking me to rate anything until I have completed the entire coursework.,4
Tooo basics and fundamental and i still did not received my certfificate,4

"I did not get a job and its bee 6 months, I have applied and applied. ",4

This course is total garbage and needs a 100% overhaul,4
"I cannot quit this course, there is no such option.",4
The assignments won't show that they are complete.,4
